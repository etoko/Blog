<h1 id="INTRODUCTION">Introduction</h1>

<p>
BGP is an open standard path vector routing application based on RFC 4271. 
As of 2023, BGP is  the only external gateway protocol in active use. 
BGP's primary purpose is to interconnect autonomous 
systems and allow the sharing of prefixes among them; Internet Service Providers 
(ISPs) use BGP to share prefixes.
Other BGP use cases include: prefix exchange in large data centers (RFC 7938) 
and scaling of DMVPN where locally significant autonomous system numbers are used.
</p>
<p>
BGP forms point-to-point peerings resulting in unicast peer relationships between 
BGP routers. 
The adjacencies between BGP peers is known as BGP sessions or peering. 
BGP does not use hello packets to discover neighbors and due to this,  
BGP routers can not discover each other dynamically. Neighbor relationships need to be configured manually.
BGP is able to form neighbor relationships across many hops; what is commonly referred to as 
a multihop relationship. This is possible because BGP uses TCP as the transport 
protocol.
</p>
<p>
BGP makes extensive use of TCP in its operations using TCP port 179 and depends 
on TCP reliability mechanisms for transmission of messages. 

 TCP is responsible for:
<ol>
<li>handling of fragmentation</li>
<li>sequencing of packets</li>
<li>ensuring packets are reliably transmitted</li>
</ol>
TCP allows for multi-hop BGP sessions. This directly implies that BGP requires the 
implementation of an interior gateway protocol (IGP) such as OSPF and IS-IS 
first in the network.
</p>

<p>
BGP provides high scalability and flexibility that does not compare to interior 
gateway protocols. 
BGP can support millions of prefixes. As of this writing, the Internet routing 
table size is approximately 940,000+ (Jan 2023) prefixes and counting.
</p>
<p>
Path selection is based on the multiple path attributes associated with each prefix
(and not the link). Path attributes are characteristics of a
prefix and include AS_PATH, local preference, multi-exit discriminator, weight and many others.
Path attributes influence the best path selection process that each BGP device makes. 
</p>
<p>
BGP supports the advertisement of directly connected networks, learned routes (static or from routing protocols) that 
exist in the RIB without the need for redistribution.
</p>
<h2>Why use BGP</h2>
<p>
 <ol>
   <li>Support for a large number of prefixes.</li>
   <li>Policy application i.e. easy to influence ingress and egress traffic.</li>
 </ol>
</p>

<p>
The following are selected use cases under which the use of BGP can be considered:
<ul>
  <li>Scaling the enterprise: to interconnect different implementations of discrete 
  IGPs.</li>
  <li>Scaling DMVPN: hubs in DMVPN can be configured as route reflectors.</li>
  <li>Scaling data centers</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEMS">Autonomous Systems</h1>
<p>
An autonomous system is a collection of routing devices under a single organization's control. 
Autonomous systems can use one or
more interior gateway protocols (IGPs) and common metrics to route packets within the autonomous system.
If multiple IGPs or metrics are used within an autonomous system, the autonomous system must appear consistent to 
external autonomous systems in routing policy. An IGP is not required within an autonomous system; 
an autonomous system could use BGP as the only routing protocol. 
</p>
<p>
Autonomous systems are uniquely identified by an autonomous system number (ASN).
Every autonomous system is provided with an autonomous system number (ASN) that 
is ultimately issued by the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/as-numbers/as-numbers.xhtml">
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (iana.org)</a>.
Originally, the ASNs issued were 2 bytes(16 bits) in the range 0 - 65535. The 
publically issued ASNs were in the range 1 - 64495. The 2 byte ASNs were depleted 
rapidly resulting in the 4 byte ASNs being adopted based on the recommendation 
of <a href="https://tools/ietf.org/html/rfc4893">RFC 4893</a>. The ASN range with 
4 bytes is 0.0 - 65535.65535.
32-bit (4 byte) autonomous system numbers have been available since 1/1/2007. 
All ASNs issued today are 32-bit.
</p>
<p> 
Two blocks of private ASNs are available for any organisation to use as long as 
they are never exchanged publically on the Internet i.e. 64512 - 65534 in the 
16-bit range and ASN 4200000000 - 4294967294 in the 32-bit range. Service providers 
sometimes assign a private ASN to an organization which is then stripped as 
the network prefix is advertised outside of the service provider's autonomous 
system. 
Private ASNs are issued to organizations that have a single connection to 
an ISP. Private ASNs should be used if an autonomous system is only required to 
communicate using BGP with a single service provider as the routing policy 
between the provider and the autonomous system will not be visible on the public 
Internet.
A private ASN received from a LIR cannot be retained if the organization migrates 
to another service provider. A public ASN is required only when an autonomous 
system is exchanging routing information with other autonomous systems on the 
public Internet i.e. all routes originating from an autonomous system are visible
on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
IANA is responsible for assigning all public ASNs to ensure that they are globally 
unique. In BGP, ASNs act as a loop prevention mechanism and can be used for traffic 
engineering. IANA requires the following information when requesting for a public ASN:
<ol>
  <li>Proof of a publically-allocated network range i.e. addresses are owned by 
  the enterprise.</li>
  <li>Proof that Internet connectivity is provided through multiple service provider connections.</li>
  <li>Need for a unique routing policy from service providers.</li>
</ol>
In the event that an organisation can not provide this information, it should use the 
ASN provided by its service provider. IANA delegates issuing ASNs to the regional 
Internet registries (RIR) such as AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE NCC. The 
appropriate RIRs then allocate blocks of ASNs to local internet registries (LIR) 
which are usually ISPs.
</p>

<h2>Special-Purpose ASNs</h2>

<h2>Types of Autonomous Systems</h2>
<p>
There are three different kinds of Autonomous Systems:
<ul>
   <li><b>Stub AS:</b> connects to only one other AS, though it may have its own
   private connections not visible to the rest of the Internet. A corporate 
   network connected to an ISP may be considered to have the same ASN as the ISP 
   it is connected to. An example is a lower-tier ISP that gets its service from
   another ISP.</li>
   <li><b>Multi-homed AS:</b> connects to two or more ASes. This allows the AS 
   to maintain its Internet connection should one AS connection fail. 
   A multi-homed autonomous system does not allow traffic from one AS to pass 
   through it to another AS. Many enterprise ASs fall in this category.</li>                                                                                            </li>
   <li><b>Transit AS:</b> interconnects two or more ASs, allowing for traffic to 
   transit through it. ISPs fall in this category. The complete path for traffic 
   may involve multiple transit AS.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Representation of 32-bit Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)</h2>
<p>
There are three ways of representing 32-bit autonomous system numbers:
<ol>
  <li><b>as-plain</b> is a simple decimal representation 0 - 4294967295. This is 
  the default AS notation used in Cisco IOS. </li>
  <li><b>asdot +</b> breaks the number up into low-order and high-order 16-bit 
  values separated by a dot. All of the older 16-bit autonomous system numbers 
  can be represented in the low-order value with the high-order value set to 
  zero for example: 65535 = 0.65535. 65536 is outside the range of the low-order
  values and is therefore represented as 1.0. 65537 is represented as 1.1. 65680
  is represented as 1.33. Conversion between decimal and asdot+ notation can be 
  done from the <a href="https://submit.apnic.net/cgi-bin/convert-asn.pl"> APNIC site</a></li>
  <li><b>asdot</b> is a mixture of asdot+ and as-plain notations. Any autonomous 
  system number in the 16-bit(2 byte) range i.e. 
  0 - 65535 is written in asplain as 65535 and any autonomous system number above
  that range is written in asdot+. To enable asdot notation, enter the command: 
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp asnotation dot</b></code> under BGP router 
  configuration mode.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h1 id="MESSAGE_TYPES">BGP Messages</h1>
<p>
BGP messages consist of the message header and message body. The message header 
 of all BGP packet types contains similar information. The BGP message body will 
 contain different formatting and information depending on the message type. 
</p>
<h2>BGP Header</h2>
<p>
All BGP packet types contain a header field. The BGP header contains the following fields: <br> <br>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-top:solid; border-width:1px; width:12%">
<b>Marker field:</b></td>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-top:solid; border-width:1px;">
16-octets and is filled with all ones but its use is now deprecated in the BGP 
standard.
It was originally used for detecting loss of synchronization between peers, 
authentication information. It is likely maintained to support backwards 
compatibility.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;"><b>Length:</b></td>
<td  style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;">
contains a value denoting the overall length of the message.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;"><b>Type:</b></td>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;">indicates what type of BGP 
message is contained in the packet i.e.
<table>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>OPEN message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>UPDATE message</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3</td><td>NOTIFICATION message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>KEEPALIVE message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td><td>ROUTE refresh</td>
</tr>

</table>
</td>
</tr>
 
</table>
<p>
An optional data field follows the header. A Keepalive message type does not contain data.
The following Wireshark packet capture shows the details of the BGP header.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marker: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff                  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length: 67                                                <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type: UPDATE Message (2)                                  <br />
                                                         <br />
</code></div>

<h2>BGP Message Types</h2>
<p>
BGP uses five message types for communication: OPEN, UPDATE, ROUTE-REFRESH, 
NOTIFICATION, and KEEPALIVE. A BGP message can contain one or more of these BGP 
message types depending on the amount of information to be transmitted.
</p>
<h3>OPEN</h3>
<p>
The BGP open message is used to establish a BGP adjacency and advertise local 
ASN, timer values, BGP identifier, BGP capabilities such as: 
multi-protocol support, route refresh capability, support for 4-octet ASNs.
4 byte ASNs support is negotiated during capability exchange. The old BGP speakers 
are sent ASdot numbers encoded as ASN "23456". The real AS-Path is encoded with 
the optional transitive attributes AS4_AGGREGATOR and AS4_PATH.
BGP OPEN messages have a value of 1 (one) in the type field of the message header.
After configuring the BGP <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor</b></code> 
command to define a neighbor, 
 BGP sends an OPEN message to try to establish a peering relationship with that 
neighbor. The OPEN message contains the 
following fields: version, My AS, holdtime, BGP identifier fields. The BGP OPEN 
packet body contains fields that advertise the local BGP capabilities.

<div>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3%">
<tr>
<td width="20%" style="border-bottom:solid;  border-top: solid; border-width:1px;"><b>Version: </b></td> 
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-top: solid; border-width:1px;">Contains 
the BGP version (usually version 4).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;"><b>My AS</b></td>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;">The autonomous system number 
of the local device. This is important for determining whether the BGP 
peering session will be iBGP or eBGP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;"><b>Hold time:</b></td>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;">
Contains sender's hold time, the recipient compares this hold timer value with 
its configured (or default) hold timer and uses the smaller hold timer value for
the peering. The minimum hold timer value needs to be either zero or at least 
three seconds. 
Monitoring of the hold timer values can be disabled by configuring a holdtimer value of zero. This also disables
the transmission of keepalive messages.
For Cisco devices, the default hold time is 180 seconds. When the hold time expires, 
the BGP session is torn down and prefixes originated by the unreachable peer are 
purged from the BGP table. An update with a route withdrawal is sent to other 
BGP peers for the affected prefixes.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;"><b>BGP Identifier:</b></td>
<td style="border-bottom:solid; border-width:1px;">
The BGP Identifier is 32-bit and is in the form of an IPv4 address. It is the 
BGP router ID. It is critical for uniquely identifying a device in the BGP peering.
The BGP identifier must have a non-zero value for routers to become peers.

<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>
When BGP devices become peers, they start exchanging their best Network Layer 
Reachability Information (NLRI) using the UPDATE message. NLRI consists of 
network prefixes, prefix length (subnet mask) and associated path attributes. 
BGP UPDATE messages have a value of 2 in the type field of the BGP header. 
They are used for advertising any feasible routes, withdrawals of previously 
advertised routes or both. UPDATE messages include  Network Layer Reachability 
Information (prefix) and associated path attributes when advertising prefixes. 
Withdrawn prefixes only include the prefix and prefix length of prefixes 
previously advertised but now being withdrawn. An UPDATE can act as a keepalive 
to reduce unnecessary traffic. UPDATE messages are sent until the complete BGP 
table has been fully exchanged.
</p>
<p>
The fields of a BGP UPDATE message include the following:
</p>

<h3>NOTIFICATION</h3>
<p>
BGP NOTIFICATION messages are sent when an error is detected with the BGP session 
such as hold timer expiring, neighbor capabilities changing or a BGP session 
hard reset being requested. This causes the BGP session to close.
NOTIFICATION messages have a value of 3 in the type field of the BGP message header.
The presence of a NOTIFICATION message in a network is a sign of a problem in BGP.
They contain the following fields:

<h3>KEEPALIVE</h3>
<p>
BGP peers exchange keepalive messages to maintain the TCP session.
Keepalive messages are exchanged every one third of the hold timer agreed upon 
between the two routers (default is 60 seconds). A hold timer of zero 
disables the transmission of KEEPALIVE messages. A KEEPALIVE message consists of 
a BGP header with no body.

<h3>ROUTE REFRESH</h3>
<p>
ROUTE-REFRESH messages are used to exchange changes in NLRI without having to reset
peerings. Route-refresh message types were not included in the original BGP RFC.
However, they are now supported by major network equipment vendors.
ROUTE-REFRESH messages have a message type value of 5 in the BGP header. 
ROUTE-REFRESH is usually set when BGP session and/or policy parameters have been 
changed and these new changes are to be implemented on the session and prefixes 
prefixes exchanged. ROUTE-REFRESH message are sent after a soft-reset command 
has been issued. A hard reset does not trigger the transmission of ROUTE-REFRESH 
messages. A ROUTE REFRESH BGP packet contains the following fields:

<h1 id="NEIGHBOR_STATE">BGP Neighbor State</h1>
<p>
BGP maintains a table of peers with which NLRI is exchanged along with their session 
state. The different BGP session states include Idle, Connect, Active, OpenSent, 
OpenConfirm and Established.
</p>

<h2>Idle</h2>
<p>
This is the state that the BGP process enters when initially configured 
or reset. In this state, the device waits for a start event such as a peering configuration
with a remote peer. After the device receives a TCP connection request from a 
remote peer, the device initiates another start event to wait for a timer before 
starting a TCP connection to a remote peer.
</p>
<p>
If an error is experienced in other BGP states, or a reset is implemented, the BGP 
state returns to the Idle state. In this state, the ConnectRetry timer is set to 
60 seconds and must decrement to zero before the connection can be initiated again. 
Any additional failures experienced in the idle state result in the ConnectRetry 
timer doubling in length from the previous time.
</p>
<h2>Connect</h2>
<p>
BGP is waiting for the TCP connection with a neighbor to be completed or a remote
BGP peer is trying to initiate a TCP connection with the local BGP device. 
If the TCP connection completes successfully;
<ul>
  <li>a BGP OPEN message is sent to the neighbor</li>
  <li>the BGP state transitions to the OpenSent.</li> 
  <li>the ConnectRetry timer is reset.</li>
</ul>
During the connect state, the router with the <b>higher IP address</b> manages the 
connection. If successful, the BGP state transitions to OpenSent. If the 
ConnectRetry timer times out before the TCP connection is successful, the BGP 
state transitions to the Active state. If BGP is reset, the state transitions 
to the Idle state.
</p>
<h2>Active</h2> 
<p>
BGP is trying to initiate a TCP connection with its peer because the TCP three-way 
handshake did not complete. TCP initiates a new three-way handshake again to 
establish a connection and the ConnectRetry timer is started. Additionally, BGP is
also listening for incoming TCP connections. If successful, an OPEN message is 
sent and the BGP state transitions to OpenSent. 
</p>
<p>
If the TCP connection fails, the state moves back to the Connect state and resets
the ConnectRetry timer. If BGP is reset or an error occurs, the state moves back 
to Idle.
</p>
<h2>OpenSent</h2>
<p>
In this state, the TCP session is up and BGP has sent an OPEN message to establish
a peering session with the remote peer. The local BGP device is waiting for the 
peer's matching OPEN message. If the peer's OPEN message is received, BGP checks 
the following parameters:
<ol>
<li>BGP router IDs must be unique. If no BGP Router ID exists, the condition 
requiring that BGP router IDs be unique is not met and a BGP peering session 
will not be created.</li>
<li>BGP versions must match.</li>
<li>OPEN message autonomous system number must match the configured neighbor's 
autonomous system number.</li>
<li>OPEN message source IP address must match the configured neighbor IP.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If the OPEN messages do not have any errors, the holdtime is negotiated and a 
KEEPALIVE message is sent. The connection state is then moved to OpenConfirm. 
If an error is found in the OPEN message, a NOTIFICATION message is sent and the 
state is moved to Idle. If TCP receives a disconect message, BGP closes the 
connection, resets the ConnectRetry timer and sets the state to Active.
</p>
<h2>OpenConfirm</h2>
<p>
The BGP router has sent a KEEPALIVE message to its peer. It now awaits for a KEEPALIVE or NOTIFICATION message 
from the peer after receiving its OPEN message. At this point, both routers have sent and received OPEN messages. If a 
KEEPALIVE message is received from the remote peer, the state transitions to established.
BGP will continue sending KEEPALIVE messages. 
</p>
<p>
If the holdtimer expires, a stop or reset event occurs or a NOTIFICATION message is received, the state is moved to Idle.
</p>
<h2>Established</h2>
<p>
BGP session has been fully established their peering relationship and neighbors can exchange routes. All neighbor 
parameters match and the peers can now exchange updates. The BGP neighbor adjacency is complete. BGP routers send UPDATE 
packets to exchange routing information. BGP resets the hold timer every time a keepalive is received or update is received.
If a NOTIFICATION message is received, the state transitions to idle state.
With the established state, a TCP session between the two BGP peers can be displayed using the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show tcp brief</b></code>.
</p>

<p>
As updates are received, the hold timer is reset. If the hold timer expires, BGP 
moves the peer back to idle state. The idle and active states for BGP routers 
that were previously in the established state is usually not a good sign.
</p>

The following output shows debugging messages displaying the various BGP state transitions:

form directly connected neighbor adjacencies or adjacencies that are many hops 
away (multi-hop adjacency). In the case of multi-hop adjacency, the BGP device 
uses a route in the routing table to form a TCP session with the remote peer. 
This route may be a static route or dynamically learned from any routing protocol. 
BGP sessions are always point-to-point between two devices. BGP peering can be 
configured to create an internal BGP (iBGP) peering or external BGP (eBGP).
</p>

<h2>Internal BGP (iBGP)</h2>
<p>
iBGP sessions are established within an AS.
 iBGP sessions are established with another BGP device that is in the same autonomous system or 
 participates in the same BGP confederation. iBGP is characterized by the 
 following features:
<ul>
 <li> iBGP prefixes are assigned an administrative distance of 200 in the routing table.</li>
 <li>iBGP uses a default TTL of 255 resulting in the possibility for iBGP peers 
 being multiple hops away from each other.</li> 
 <li>The AS_Path is not appended to a prefix when it is shared with an iBGP peer.</li>
 <li>Prefixes learned from an iBGP peer can not be sent to another iBGP peer. 
 This is iBGP's way of preventing the formation of routing loops. This is the 
 iBGP concept of <b>split horizon.</b>
 In order to prevent the formation of "traffic blackholes", iBGP uses a variety 
 of techniques such as full-mesh topology, route reflection, and confederations 
 which ensure that all iBGP peers receive shared NLRI and eliminates traffic 
 black-holing.
 </li>
  <li>In iBGP, the next hop address field is left unchanged when advertising a 
  prefix to another iBGP peer if it is an address other than 0.0.0.0. </li>
  <li>The next-hop address must exist in the routing table in order for the 
  prefix to be advertised to iBGP peers.</li>
  <li>iBGP peers typically peer via loopbacks: this allows for rerouting around 
  failed paths with IGPs providing alternate paths. Additionally, this is 
  required for some BGP implementations such as in MPLS L3VPNs.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>External BGP (eBGP)</h2>
<p>
eBGP sessions are established between autonomous systems. 
eBGP peerings are the core of component of BGP on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>
eBGP has the following features:
<ul>
   <li>eBGP prefixes are assigned an administrative distance of 20 in the 
   routing table. The lower AD of eBGP compared to iBGP is an indication that  
   BGP is designed to share prefixes between autonomous systems rather than 
   within autonomous systems.</li>
   <li>The advertising BGP peer prepends its autonomous system number to the 
   AS_Path path attribute. The receiving router first confirms that the AS_Path 
   does not contain the local autonomous system number and processes the packet. 
   If the local autonomous system number is contained in the AS_Path, then the 
   packet is discarded to prevent a routing loop.</li>
   <li><b>External peers are directly connected (by default):</b> eBGP places a 
   Time-to-live (TTL) of one (1) to avoid the use of any other routing path.
   However, if any one of the directly connected interfaces fail, the eBGP session 
   may get torn down. This can be modified using the BGP commands 
   <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt;  
   ebgp-multihop &lt;1 - 255&gt;</b></code> or  
   <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor  &lt;ip-address&gt; ttl-security hops &lt;1 - 255&gt;</b></code>.
   
   The TTL-security feature can be configured to enforce the requirement for the 
   neighbors to be directly adjacent. TTL-security needs to be configured on both 
   BGP peers. TTL-Security is covered in depth in the section 
   <a href="#SECURITY">BGP Security</a>
   </li>
   <li>eBGP peering can use a loopback interface as the outgoing interface. 
   In such a configuration, the requirement for directly connected peers can be 
   disabled using the BGP command 
   <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; disable-connected-check</b></code>.
   <li>The next-hop field is changed for prefixes received from an eBGP peer. 
   The local router modifies the next hop to the IP address of its exit interface 
   when it advertises to an iBGP peer a prefix received from an eBGP peer. </li>
 </ul>
</p>

<h1>BGP Session Configuration</h1>
<p>
BGP peer configuration can be classified as session commands and policy commands.
Session commands are global in scope i.e., apply to all address families (IPv4, IPv6, 
VPNv6, IPv4 multicast) or per address family. The policy commands are always 
per address family.
</p>
<p>
BGP configuration involves defining session parameters, address-family initialization 
and activation of the neighbor under the appropriate address family. By default, BGP
on Cisco devices has IPv4 address family enabled. The default IPv4 address family
can be disabled using the BGP router command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>no bgp default ipv4-unicast</b></code>.

If the default IPv4 address-family is disabled, the following three-phase BGP configuration must be completed:
<h2>Phase 1: BGP session parameters</h2> 
The neighbor IP address and autonomous system number is configured. Other parameters configured include:
authentication, keepalive timers, source and destination IP address settings.
</p>
<p>
The configuration of BGP session involves the following commands:
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> initialize the BGP process using the privileged mode command 
<code><b>router bgp &lt;asn&gt;</b></code>:
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">R8(config)#<b>router bgp 1.3</b></code>
</div>
<p>
The configured ASN is 1.3.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 2: </b> define the BGP router ID statically with the command <code><b>
bgp router-id &lt;router-id&gt;</b></code>:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>bgp router-id 8.8.8.8</b>
</code>
</div>
<p>
Like IGPs, IOS automatically assigns the RID using the following criteria:
<ol>
 <li>Statically defined router-id.</li>
 <li>Highest IP address configured on any loopback interface. </li>
 <li>Highest IP address of any physical interface.</li>
</ol>
It is recommended that the BGP router ID be statically configured. This ensures 
that it does not change even when the interface IP addresses for the loopback and 
physical interfaces are modified.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3: </b> define the BGP neighbor's IP address and autonomous system number with the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; remote-as 
&lt;asn&gt;</b></code>. 
You need to know the outbound interface IP address of the remote router. For 
iBGP peers, the ASN will be same as that of the local BGP device. For eBGP peers,
the ASN values will be different.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 remote-as 65536</b>
</code>
</div>
<p>
<b>Step 4 (Optional): </b> define the BGP session's password with MD5 authentication using the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; password &lt;password&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 password cisco123</b>
</code></div>
<p>
Failure to configure a password does not affect the operational state of BGP. However, it provides a layer of security 
to BGP operations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 5 (Optional): </b> modify the BGP session timers with the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; timers &lt;keepalive&gt; 
&lt;holdtime&gt; &lt;[minimum-holdtime]&gt;</b></code>. 
A neighbor relationship does not form if the configured holdtime on one neighbor is lower than the minimum-holdtime on 
another neighbor.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 timers 60 180 120</b>
</code></div>
<p>
The above command configures a keepalive timer value of 60 seconds, holdtime of 180 seconds and minimum holdtime of 120 
seconds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 6 (if using the IP address of a loopback interface):</b> specify the 
source interface of the BGP session. By default, the IP address of the exit 
interface (as determined by the RIB) is used as the source IP address of a BGP 
packet. However, during configuration, it is possible to use an IP address of an
interface that is not the exit interface. In such scenarios, usually a loopback 
interface is used. This guards against losing a BGP peering due to link failure. 
This is important in highly redundant networks with more than one path to a peer.
The interface to be used for a BGP session can be configured using the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; update-source &lt;interface-id&gt;</b></code>.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 update-source loopback 0</b>
</code></div>
<p>
If the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>update-source</b></code> command is issued, then, for eBGP sessions, the TTL must be increased from one (1) to 
a higher value (two in this case).

eBGP sessions use a TTL of one for BGP packets as a security measure. This default 
behaviour prevents multihop eBGP sessions that could be necessary when providers 
would like to peer via loopback addresses. This requires changing the TTL on 
BGP packets between eBGP peers. To change the TTL for multihop eBGP 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; ebgp-multihop 
&lt;hop_count&gt;</b></code>.
</p>


<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 ebgp-multihop 2</b>
</code></div>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> eBGP sessions using loopback interfaces can be enabled using the keyword 
<code style="font-size:120%;"><b>disable-connected-check</b></code> fo the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>neighbor</b></code>
command. This keyword disables the default eBGP checks for a TTL of one and the 
requirement for the eBGP neighbors to be in the same subnet. You can use this 
keyword to replace the keyword of <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>ebgp-multihop</b></code>. However, 
this still requires the eBGP neighbors to be directly connected. eBGP multihop 
sessions cannot be enabled using this command. The ebgp-multihop keyword will 
be required in such a scenario.
</p>

<h2>Verification of Neighbor State</h2>
<p>
The neighbor state of BGP peers can be verified using the command <code style="font-size:120%;">
<b>show ip bgp summary</b></code>.
</p>


<h2>Phase 2: Address family initialization and Prefix Advertisement</h2>
<p>
Network advertisement and route summarization are implemented under the address family mode.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 7: Initialize the address family:</b> using the BGP command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>address-family &lt;afi&gt; &lt;safi&gt;</b></code></li>.
In this configuration, we initialize IPv4 unicast address family.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>address-family ipv4 unicast</b>
</code></div>
<p>
<b>Step 8: Advertise the network layer reachability information (NLRI) i.e. 
prefixes and their attributes.</b>
</p>

<p>
BGP uses the UPDATE message to advertise and withdraw NLRI.
NLRI can be originated in multiple ways:
<ul>
  <li><b>Network statement:</b> The syntax of the network statement is <code><b>network &lt;ip-address&gt; 
     mask &lt;netmask&gt;</b></code>. 
     <ul> 
      <li>Prefixes originated using the network statement have an ORIGIN path 
      attribute of IGP with the status symbol "i" in the BGP table.</li>
      <li>Prefixes have to exist in the routing table before they are advertised.
      They do not have to be a connected or static routes; they can be sourced  
      from IGPs.</li> 
      <li>When configuring the network statement, the routes to be advertised 
      must match the prefix in the routing table.</li>
      <li>Without the <code><b>mask</b></code> keyword, the BGP uses a classful
      mask instead. If subnets or supernets are to be advertised, then the 
      <code style="font-size:120%"><b>mask</b></code> keyword may be required.</li>
      <li>BGP sets the weight path attribute to 32768 for these prefixes.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>redistribute statement:</b> 
  <ul>
     <li>Won't include OSPF external by default. 
     <li>To include OSPF external prefixes add the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>match ospf external</b></code>
     keywords.</li>
     <li>Originates prefixes with ORIGIN INCOMPLETE(?).</li> 
     <li>Originates classful summary if <code style="font-size:120%"><b>auto-summary</b></code> is enabled. 
     <li>Automatically copies IGP metric to BGP MED.</li>
     <li>Won't include OSPF external by default. <code style="font-size:120%"><b>redistribute ospf [pid] 
     match internal external</b></code> to include OSPF external routes.</li>
     <li>Sets the weight to 32768.</li>
     <b>BGP Redistribute Internal</b>
     <uL>
       <li>By default, only external BGP routes are redistributed into IGP with
       redistribution.</li>
       <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp redistribute internal</b></code> command lets internal 
       BGP routes to be redistributed into IGP. Can result in a routing loop if 
       not carefully planned and implemented.</li>
     </uL>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>aggregate-address statement:</b> requires one subnet in the BGP table first.</li>
  <li><b>bgp inject-map statement:</b> Opposite of aggregation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>BGP Conditional Advertisement</h4>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Neighbor adverise-map map1 [non-exist-map map2 | exist-map map2].</li>
 <li>Advertise prefix matched in advertise-map; if prefix matched in non-exist-map
 does not exist or prefix matched in exist-map does exist.</li>
 <li>Typically used to track failure of a transit link e.g. advertise to backup 
 provider, only if primary provider is down.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h3>Conditional Route Injection</h3>
<p>
Originates subnets(s) from aggregate for purpose of longest match traffic 
engineering. This is the opposite of aggregation where the shorter match is taken 
and originating longer match prefixes from it for traffic engineering.
</p>

<h4>BGP Conditional Route Injection Configuration</h4>
<p>

Configured as <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp inject-map inject-map exist-map exist-map [copy-attributes]
</b></code>. 
<ul>
Inject Map
  <ul>
  <li>Subnet to be advertised</li>
  <li>set ip address prefix-list [list]</li>
  </ul>
  Exist Map
  <ul>
    <li>Aggregate to be originated from i.e. learned path.</li>
    <li>match ip address prefix-list [list]</li>
    <li>match ip route-source prefix-list [list]</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
In the exist-map, two matches need to be done;
<ol>
  <li>Match the prefix using the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>match ip address</b></code> command</li>
  <li>Match the source using a <code style="font-size:120%"><b>match ip route-source</b></code> command
</ol>
</p>
<h4>Example Configuration</h4>
<p>
Given an aggregate prefix 150.1.0.0/16 received from a peer 150., we want to 
advertise a component route 150.1.1.0/24. <br>
Step 1: Match the aggregate in a prefix-list: 
<code style="font-size:120%">
ip prefix-list AGGREGATE permit 150.1.0.0/16.
</code>
<br>
Step 2: Match the prefix that we want to originate:<br>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
ip prefix-list R1_LOOPBACK permit 150.1.1.0/24
</b></code>
<br>
Step 3: Match the route source i.e. prefix best path: <br>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
ip prefix-list ROUTE_SOURCE 150.1.28.5/32
</b></code>
Step 4: Configure route-map that is the inject-map:<br>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
route-map INJECT_MAP<br>
set ip address prefix-list R1_LOOPBACK<br>
route-map EXIST_MAP<br>
match ip address prefix-list AGGREGATE<br>
match ip route-source prefix-list ROUTE_SOURCE<br>  
</b></code> <br>

Step 5: Apply the inject-map and exist-map;<br>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
router bgp 801.1<br>
bgp inject-map INJECT_MAP exist-map EXIST_MAP<br>
</b></code>
</p>
<p>
Verify configuration with the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show ip bgp injected-paths</b></code>.
</p>

<p>
Care must be taken when configuring the prefixes to be advertised. The prefix and subnet mask must be configured exactly 
as they appear in the routing table. These prefixes must already exist in the routing table.
The source of the prefixes in the routing table  may be static, connected, or known from another routing protocol.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router-af)#<b>network 10.8.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0</b> <br>
R8(config-router-af)#<b>network 10.8.11.0 mask 255.255.255.0</b> <br>
</code></div>

<h2>Phase 3: Activation of the BGP Peer</h2
<p>
A BGP peer must be activated in order for BGP to initiate a session with that peer. The router's IP address is added 
to the neighbor table and BGP attempts to establish a BGP session or accepts a BGP session initiated from the peer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 9: Activate the neighbor:</b> using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address>&gt; activate</b></code> 
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 activate</b>
</code></div>
<p>
If the default BGP IPv4 address family is enabled, then activation of a neighbor is done automatically.
</p>

<h2>Peer Groups</h2>
<p>
Peer groups simplify BGP configuration and reduce system resource use (CPU and memory) by grouping BGP peers together 
into BGP update groups. Configuration of multiple neighbors can be done in one place.
BGP update groups enable a BGP device to perform outbound routing policy processing one time and then replicate the 
update to all members. All members in the peer group are in the same update group and therefore must be of the same 
session type i.e. iBGP or eBGP but not mixed up.
</p>
<p>
BGP peer groups simplify BGP configuration when there are multiple routers 
assigned to a peer group. A BGP peer group is created through the following steps:
<ul>
  <li><b>Step 1:</b> Create the peer group using the BGP router command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;group_name&gt; peer-group</b></code>.
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor AS65000 peer-group        </b>
</code></div>
</p>
</li>
  <li><b>Step 2:</b> Add BGP peers to the peer group using the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address &gt;peer-group &lt;group_name&gt;</b></code>.
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 4.4.4.4 remote-as 65000   </b> <br>
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 5.5.5.5 remote-as 65000   </b> <br>
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 4.4.4.4 peer-group AS65000</b> <br>
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 5.5.5.5 peer-group AS65000</b> <br>
</code></div>
</p>
</li>
  <li>
  <p>
  <b>Step 3:</b> All BGP parameters are configured using <code style="font-size:120%"><b>peer-group &lt;group_name&gt;</b></code> in lieu of 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt;</b></code>.
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor AS65000 next-hop-self     </b> <br>
</code></div>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
BGP neighbors cannot be activated by a peer group name and must be activated for each address family by IP address.
</p>

<p>
The following actions can be implemented against a peer-group that will affect the peer-group's individual members:
<ol>
  <li><b>Reset of BGP neighborship:</b> This can be a soft reset or hard reset e.g. 
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>R6#clear bgp ipv4 unicast peer-group AS65000 soft out</b></code>.</li>
  <li><b>Route-filtering using route-maps, distribute-lists and filter-lists.</b>
</ol>
Peer groups can be verified using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show ip bgp update-group</b></code>.
</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting Peer Groups</h3>
<p>
When troubleshooting peer group issues, you need to take note of the following:
<ul>
  <li>The neighbor ip address was not associated with the configured peer group.
  <li>The peer group is not configured correctly; what works for one neighbor might not work for the other. 
  <li>The route filter applied to the group is not appropriate for all the peers.
  <li>If there are conflicting entries between the peer group and a specific neighbor statement, 
  the neighbor statement wins.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Peer Templates</h2>
<p>
BGP peer templates are BGP configurations that can be applied to one or more BGP peers. 
BGP peer templates can inherit configurations from other peer templates.
If a conflict exists between an inherited configuration and the invoking
peer template, the invoking template preempts the inherited value.
There are two types of BGP peer templates: peer session templates and peer policy 
templates.

</p>

<h3>Peer session</h3> 
<p>
This type of template involves configuration settings specifically for the BGP session.
Peer session templates are used to group and apply the configuration of general BGP session commands to
groups of neighbors that share session configuration. 
Peer session templates can be applied regardless of address families of the neighbors.
</p>
<p>
General session commands can be configured once in a peer session template and then applied to many
neighbors through the direct application of a peer session template or through indirect inheritance from a peer
session template.
Peer session templates support direct and indirect inheritance. A BGP neighbor can be configured with only
one peer session template at a time, and that peer session template can contain only one indirectly inherited
peer session template. A BGP neighbor can directly inherit only one session template and can indirectly inherit
up to seven additional peer session templates.
</p>
<p>
You define peer session template settings with the BGP configuration command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>template peer-session &lt;template-name&gt;</b></code> and then
enter any BGP session related configuration commands.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6#<b>configure terminal</b><br>
R6(config)#<b>router bgp 65000</b><br>
R6(config-router)#<b>template peer-session BGP_SESSION_TEMPLATE_AS65000</b><br>
R6(config-router-stmp)#<b>remote-as 65000</b><br>
R6(config-router-stmp)#<b>update-source loopback0</b><br>
R6(config-router-stmp)#<b>timers 30 90 60</b>
</code></div>
<p>
The peer-session template can then be applied to a group of BGP peers using the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>inherit</b></code> keyword 
in BGP router mode.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 4.4.4.4 inherit peer-session BGP_SESSION_TEMPLATE_AS65000</b><br>
R6(config-router)#<b>neighbor 5.5.5.5 inherit peer-session BGP_SESSION_TEMPLATE_AS65000</b>
</code></div>

<p>
Verification of the peer-session can be done using the privileged mode command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast template peer-session</b></code>
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">

<h3>Peer policy</h3>
<p>
Peer policy templates are used to configure BGP policy commands for neighbors that
belong to specific address families. Peer policy templates are configured once and then applied to many
neighbors through the direct application of a peer policy template or through inheritance from peer policy
templates. The configuration of peer policy templates simplifies the configuration of BGP policy commands
that are applied to all neighbors within an autonomous system.
</p>
<p>
Peer policy templates support inheritance. A directly applied peer policy template can directly or indirectly
inherit configurations from up to seven peer policy templates. So, a total of eight peer policy templates can
be applied to a neighbor or neighbor group.
</p>

<p>
BGP policy configuration commands that are configured only for a specific address family.
You define peer policy template settings with the BGP configuration command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>template peer-policy &lt;template-name&gt;</b></code> and
then enter any BGP address familyrelated configuration commands. 
</p>

<p>
BGP peer policy templates are applied to a BGP peer in address-family mode using 
the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>inherit</b></code> keyword.

<b>Note:</b> A BGP peer cannot inherit from a peer-policy template or peer-session 
template and be configured as a peer group member at the same time. BGP templates

the BGP session may need to be refreshed to take effect. 
BGP supports two methods of cleaning a session:
<ul>
<li><b>Hard reset:</b> tears down a BGP session and removes routes from a peer. 
When a hard reset is initiated, BGP ends the session by closing the TCP connection to the BGP peer. It does this by 
sending a TCP message with the connection finish flag set (FIN) and a TCP handshake to end the connection is 
initiated. No ROUTE-REFRESH messages are exchanged with a hard reset.
<p>
A hard reset is implemented using the command
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear bgp ipv4 unicast &lt;ip_address&gt;</b></code>.
A hard reset is not recommended in production networks as it clears the entire 
Loc-RIB table which may be massive and may additionally have a cascading effect.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Soft Reset: </b>invalidates the cache and requests full advertisement.
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear bgp ipv4 unicast &lt;ip_address&gt; soft</b></code>.
<b>Soft reconfiguration: </b>
We can configure a neighbor to support soft reconfiguration for inbound updates.
For outbound soft reconfig is supported by default. Soft reconfiguration can be 
enabled for a neighbor using the BGP address family command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor 
&lt;ip-address&gt; soft-reconfiguration inbound</b></code>. For Outbound soft 
reconfiguration, no neighbor manipulation in configuration is required as the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear ip bgp &lt;ip-address&gt; soft out</b></code> is sufficient.
</li>
</ul>
Sessions can be cleared with all neighbors by using an asterisk in lieu of the peer's IP address. ROUTE-REFRESH messages 
are sent by the device that initiated the route refresh to all BGP peers if an asterisk is used or to the BGP peer 
whose IP address has been used in the refresh command in lieu of the asterisk.

</p>
<h3>BGP Route Refresh Capability</h3>
<p>
Negotiated capability sent in OPEN message. The TCP connnection between the peers
is not cut off. Can ask peer to send an update without having to hard clear the 
session. It does not consume memory like soft reconfigure inbound. Can be 
implemented using the command:
clear bgp ipv4 unicast [neighbor] soft in,
clear bgp ipv4 unicast [neighbor] in
clear bgp ipv4 unicast * in

</p>
<p>
When a BGP policy changes, the BGP table must be updated and the neighbors 
notified accordingly. If the BGP session supports route refresh capability, the 
peer re-advertises (refreshes) the prefixes to the requesting router allowing for the inbound
policy to process using the new policy changes. Route refresh capability is made
possible by the availability of the route refresh message type.
The route refresh capability is 
negotiated for each address family when the
session is established. Performing a soft refresh on sessions that support route refresh capability actually initiates a 
route refresh. Soft resets can be performed for a specific address family with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear bgp afi safi &lt;ip_address&gt; soft &lt;(in | out)&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
Soft reconfiguration is used in environments where route refresh capability is 
not supported.

<h2>Peer Authentication</h2>
<p>
A BGP session can be configured to enable authentication of BGP messages received 
from a BGP peer. The keyword <code style="font-size:120%"><b>password</b></code> is appended to the 
neighbor statement or to a peer-session template.  
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R8(config-router)#<b>neighbor 7.7.7.7 password cisco123</b>
</code></div>
<p>
BGP peer authentication using the keyword <code style="font-size:120%"><b>password</b></code> implements 
MD5 authentication. BGP uses the TCP header to carry the MD5 digest of the password between BGP peers.
The following snippet shows a Wireshark packet capture of a BGP packet containing MD5 authentication.

<h2>TTL Security Check for BGP Neighbor Sessions</h2>
<p>
When implemented for BGP, the TTL security check introduces a lightweight 
security mechanism to protect eBGP neighbor sessions from CPU utilization-based 
attacks. These types of attacks are typically brute force Denial of Service (DoS) 
attacks that attempt to degrade the network by flooding it with
IP packets that contain forged source and destination IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
The BGP Support for TTL Security Check feature is configured with the 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; ttl-security hops &lt;1-254&gt;</b></code> command in
router configuration mode or address family configuration mode.
The hop-count argument is used
to configure the maximum number of hops that separate the two peers. The TTL value is determined by the
router from the configured hop count. The value for this argument is a number from 1 to 254.
Configuring a hop value to one (1) results in the dropping of a peer session that 
is more than one hop away, although the BGP messages will contain a TTL value 
of 255.
</p>
<p>
The TTL security check protects the eBGP neighbor session by comparing the value in the TTL field
of received IP packets against a hop count that is configured locally for each eBGP neighbor session. If the
value in the TTL field of the incoming IP packet is greater than or equal to the locally configured value, the
IP packet is accepted and processed normally. If the TTL value in the IP packet is less than the locally
configured value, the packet is silently discarded and no Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message
is generated. This is the designed behavior; a response to a forged packet is unnecessary.
Although it is possible to forge the TTL field in an IP packet header, accurately forging the TTL count to
match the TTL count from a trusted peer is impossible unless the trusted peer 
has been compromised.
</p>
<p>
TTL security check supports both directly connected neighbor sessions and multihop eBGP
neighbor sessions. The BGP neighbor session is not affected by incoming packets that contain invalid TTL
values. The BGP neighbor session will remain open, and the router will silently discard the invalid packet.
The BGP session, however, can still expire if keepalive packets are not received before the session timer
expires. This results in a NOTIFICATION message being sent with the error code of Hold Timer Expired.

<p>
From the output, the device's TCP connections indicate that the local device is a BGP client to devices 5.5.5.5 
and 4.4.4.4. The local device acts as a BGP server to the remote BGP peer 10.67.1.2.
</p>
<p>
BGP sessions are server/client relationships with one peer acting as a server and 
another as the client. The BGP peer acting as the server opens TCP port 179 
and listens for connections on this port. The client initiates connections to 
the server on port 179 using an ephemeral port as the source TCP port. The TCP 
server must agree on where the clients session is coming from i.e. the IP address 
of the client. If a client's IP address has not be preconfigured on the server, 
it will frop the TCP connection attempt from the client with a TCP RST packet.
</p>
<p>
BGP peers use the TCP three-way handshake to create a BGP session. If both peers 
try to create a TCP session at the same time, when initiating the TCP three-way 
handshake, both peers send a TCP SYN packet sourced from an ephemeral port and 
destined to port 179. If the TCP SYN lpacket is sent at the the same type by both peers, both BGP peers respond with 
an ACK to the request on port 179, resulting in two BGP sessions being created.  
This condition is called a <b>BGP connection collision</b>. BGP handles this 
condition by making the BGP peer with the higher BGP RID to become the server 
and maintaining only one TCP session between the two BGP peers. 
To avoid BGP connection collisions, the server and client roles can be predetermined 
right from the start by using the
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; transport connection-mode &lt;active | passive&gt;</b></code> command where active means 
client, passive means server.
</p>
<p>
Client connections can be viewed using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show control-plane 
host open-ports</b></code>; this command may be version specific. The client's 
packet is sourced from the outgoing interface in the routing table. However, 
this can be modified using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>update-source</b></code> 
per neighbor.

<h2>BGP Processes</h2>
<p>
BGP runs various processes simultaneously. These can be viewed by filtering the 
output of the running processes for BGP; <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>show  processes cpu | include BGP</b></code>.
The four major BGP processes include:
<ol>
  <li><b>Scheduler:</b> schedules the various processes used by BGP.</li>
  <li><b>Router:</b> processes policy, best path algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>IO:</b> responsible for moving prefixes into the InQ and and out of the OutQ.</li>
  <li><b>Scanner:</b> watches for changes such as next hop unreachability and removal 
  of prefixes because of this. It evaluates prefixes as a result of the configuration 
  of the network command. The scanner runs every 60 seconds by default. 
  This can be modified using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>bgp scan-time &lt;5-60&gt;</b></code></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Other significant BGP processes include the following: these processes support the 
operation of the scanner process;
<ol>
  <li><b>BMP Server:</b> for the BGP monitoring protocol for monitoring the BGP neighborships.</li>
  <li><b>NHT:</b> next hop tracker process helps the scanner for scanning changes in the 
  reachability of the next hop</li>
  <li><b>Event:</b> responds to new network statement, new redistribute statements.</li>
  <li><b>Import Scanner:</b> to assist the scanner with labels in MPLS environment.</li>
  <li><b>Open:</b> used in establishing a peering with a new BGP peer.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1 id="BGP_TABLES">BGP Tables</h1>
<p>
BGP uses three tables for maintaining the network paths and path attributes for 
a prefix: Loc-RIB (BGP table), Adj-RIB-in,
and Adj-RIB-out tables.
</p>
<h2>Loc-RIB (BGP Table)</h2>
<p>
Loc-RIB is used by BGP to present routes to the IP routing table. It contains 
NLRI for prefixes locally originated or received from other peers. After the 
NLRI passes validity and next-hop reachability checks, the BGP best path algorithm 
selects the best NLRI for a specific prefix.
</p>

<p>
BGP implements loop prevention in the Loc-RIB table by default; prefixes with the 
local AS in the AS-Path path attribute will be dropped in the Loc-RIB table unless
this default configuration is disabled.
</p>

<p>
Locally originated network prefixes are installed into the BGP table with the 
command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>network &lt;ip-address&gt; mask &lt;subnetmask&gt; 
[route-map &lt;route-map-name&gt;]</b></code>. 
The optional route map can be used to modify BGP path attributes at the time the 
route is installed into the Loc-RIB.  
</p>
<p>
The BGP <code style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">network</code> command 
does not enable BGP on a specific interface. It is used to identify networks that 
already exist in the RIB that should be installed in the Loc-RIB table. The 
<code style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">network</code> command must 
match the prefix and subnet mask exactly it is in the RIB.

The BGP process searches the global RIB for an exact network prefix match. 
The network prefix can be a connected network, a secondary connected network, 
or prefix learned from an interior gateway protocol such as OSPF, IS-IS.
After verifying that the <code style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">network
</code> command matches the prefix in the global RIB, the prefix is installed 
into the BGP Loc-RIB table. As the prefix is installed into the Loc-RIB table, 
the following path attributes are set, depending on the RIB prefix type:
<ul>
<li><b>Connected network:</b> for prefixes that are directly connected: 
 <ol>
   <li>The next-hop path attribute is set to 0.0.0.0</li>
   <li>BGP origin attribute is set to i (for IGP)</li>
   <li>BGP weight is set to 32,768.</li>
   </ol></li>
<li><b>Static route or routing protocol:</b> for prefixes that are learnt through 
a routing protocol or statically configured:
  <ol>
  <li>Next-hop path attribute is set to the next-hop IP address in the RIB.</li> 
  <li>BGP origin attribute is set to i (for IGP)</li>
  <li>BGP weight is set to 32,768</li>
  <li>Multi-exit discriminator (MED) is set to the IGP metric.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The Loc-RIB table can be viewed using the command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>
show bgp ipv4 unicast</b></code>. See output and description of 
this command under the section: <a href="#PREFIX_VERIFICATION">Verifying BGP Prefixes</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the Loc-RIB table, redistributed routes have "?" for origin code. When receiving 
prefixes, inbound route policies are checked prior to the route being inserted 
into the Loc-RIB. After insertion into the Loc-RIB, a next-hop check is performed.
Then identification of the best BGP path is performed and prefix is then inserted into the RIB.
</p>
<p>
Outbound route policies are performed before prefixes enter Adj-RIB-out and then advertised to peers.
Only the best paths are advertised to peers and therefore outbound route policies 
apply to the best paths.
</p>


<h3>Parsing the BGP Table using Regexp Queries</h3>
<p>
The Internet BGP table contains over 800,000 prefixes. When querying this massive 
BGP table, the use of regular expressions makes it easier to retrieve required 
information.

The BGP table can be parsed with regular expressions using the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp &lt;afi&gt; &lt;safi&gt; regexp &lt;regex-pattern&gt;</b></code>. 
These regular expressions can also be used to filter through the large number of 
available ASNs (4,294,967,295).

<h3>Loc-RIB Table Version</h3>
<p>
The BGP table can be viewed using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast summary</b></code>.
Two table version information is displayed in the output: BGP table version and 
main routing table version. When update messages are received, the BGP table version 
increments by one and the main routing table version remains stale in comparison.
This is triggered by prefix manipulations.
</p>
<p>
A rapidly incrementing BGP table version may point to instability of the BGP. This 
can be a clue to assisting with troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
To view the BGP table version for a specific NLRI, issue the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast &lt;prefix&gt;</b></code>.
</p>

<h2>Adj-RIB-in</h2>
<p>
The Adj-RIB-in table contains NLRI (prefixes and their path attributes) received from a 
neighbor before processing of inbound route policies. After all route policies 
are processed, the prefixes and their associated path attributes are stored in the Loc-RIB 
table and the Adj-RIB-in table is purged to save memory.
</p>
<!--
<p>
If a prefix has already been installed into the Loc-RIB from a source such as a 
static route or IGP, and the same prefix information is received through a BGP 
update packet into the Adj-RIB-in, this BGP sourced prefix may not be installed 
into the Loc-RIB due to the inferior Administrative distance of BGP. 
</p>  -->
<p>
The Adj-RIB-in table can be viewed by running the command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>
show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; received-routes</b></code>.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R7#<b>show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors 10.67.1.1 received-routes</b><br>            
% Inbound soft reconfiguration not enabled on 10.67.1.1                <br> 
R7#
</code></div>
<p>
<p>
The output above indicates that the display of the Adj-RIB-in table is not enabled. 
Viewing the Adj-RIB-in table is disabled by default.
To enable the Adj-RIB-in table, issue the command: <code style="font-size:120%">
<b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; soft-reconfiguration inbound</b></code> in 
address-family mode. To implement any new route policies, carry out a soft BGP reset.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R7(config-router)#<b>address-family ipv4 unicast</b> <br>
R7(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor 10.67.1.1 soft-reconfiguration inbound</b>
</code></div>
<p>
The BGP route policy can then be configured and applied to the neighbor. In this case, the local preference of all prefixes 
from a neighbor is set to 500 using a route-map named RM_LOCALPREF_500.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R7(config)#<b>route-map RM_LOCAL_PREF_500 permit 10</b><br>
R7(config-route-map)#<b>set local-preference 500</b><br>
R7(config-route-map)#<b>exit</b><br>
R7(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor 10.67.1.1 route-map RM_LOCAL_PREF_500 in</b><br>
R7(config-router-af)#<b>end</b>
</code></div>

<p>
To enforce the routing policy on the prefixes from the neighbor, the neighbor is requested to resend its prefixes using 
a soft reset on the local BGP device.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R7#<b>clear bgp ipv4 unicast 10.67.1.1 soft in</b>
</code></div>

<p>
The following output shows a summary of the packet exchange between the local BGP device and its remote peer after a 
soft reset is configured.

<p>
The above output shows that the local preference of the routes received was updated by the route map and installed into 
the routing table. Using the Adj-RIB-in, it is possible to view routes prior to the implementation of routing policies.
</p>

<h2>Adj-RIB-out</h2>
<p>
The Adj-RIB-out table contains NLRI after outbound route policies have been processed. 
The Adj-RIB-Out table is maintained for each BGP peer. It contains routes advertised 
to a specific router. The command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors 
&lt;ip-address&gt; advertised-routes</b></code> displays the contents of the Adj-RIB-Out 
table for a neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Prefix summarization or aggregation takes place in the Adj-RIB-out table if configured.
</p>

<h2 id="PREFIX_ADVERTISEMENT">Prefix Advertisement</h2>
<p>
Local prefixes are inserted into the BGP table using the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>network</b></code>
 command as well as through redistribution using the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>redistribution</b></code>
 command. Locally originated prefixes have an origin code of IGP (i).
</p>
<h3>Redistribution</h3>
<p>
Redistribution of IGP routes into the BGP table can be accomplished using the 
BGP <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>redistribution</b></code> command. This command includes several 
options among which includes the route-map option to reference a route map that 
can be used to filter prefixes to be redistributed as well as modify the path 
attributes of these prefixes.
</p>
<p>
Redistributed prefixes have an origin code of incomplete.
</p>
<p>
IGPs were not designed for the massive number of prefixes that BGP was designed 
for. It is therefore not recommended to redistributing NLRI into IGPs.
</p>

<h3>RIB-Failure</h3>
<p>
The BGP table may show some prefixes with a status code of <b>rib-failure (r)</b>.
A rib-failure indicates that BGP best path for a prefix cannot be installed into 
the routing table in spite of the prefix being valid and having a path to the 
BGP next hop. One of the primary reasons for rib-failures is the higher 
administrative distance (AD). This is particularly the case if a prefix is learned 
through iBGP and an IGP. iBGP has a higher default administrative distance of 200 
than most IGPs.
</p>
<p>
The list of prefixes with a rib-failure and the reason for the rib-failure can 
be viewed using the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>show ip bgp rib-failure</b></code>.
</p>

<p>
A rib-failure does not prevent the propagation of a prefix by BGP. To stop the 
propagation of prefixes that experience a rib-failure or any other prefix that 
is not marked as "active", issue the BGP commmand <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>bgp suppress-inactive</b></code>
. This stops the propagation, through BGP, of any prefixes that are not marked 
as active in the BGP table.
</p>
<p>
To force the injection of BGP prefixes with a rib-failure into the routing table
 would be to lower the administrative distance of iBGP to lower that of the IGP.
</p>

<h2 id="PREFIX_PROCESSING">Prefix Processing</h2>
<p>
Not every prefix in the Loc-RIB table is advertised to BGP peers or installed into the global RIB. When a route is received from a peer,
BGP performs the following route processing steps:
<ul>
  <li><b>Step 1:</b> Store the route in the Adj-RIB-In table in the original state and apply the inbound route policy, 
  based on the neighbor from which it was received.</li>
  <li><b>Step 2:</b> Update the Loc-RIB table with the latest entry. The Adj-RIB-In table is cleared to save memory.</li>
  <li><b>Step 3:</b> Pass a validity check to verify that the route is valid and that the next-hop address is resolvable in the 
  global RIB. If the route fails, the route remains in the Loc-RIB table but is not processed further.</li>
  <li><b>Step 4:</b> Identify the BGP best path and pass only the best path and its path attributes to step 5.</li>
  <li><b>Step 5:</b> Install the best-path route into the global RIB, process the outbound route policy, store the non-discarded 
  routes in the Adj-RIB-Out table, and advertise to BGP peers. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>eBGP and iBGP Route Advertisement Behaviours</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Differences in eBGP Behaviour from iBGP</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>With eBGP, the TTL of packets is set to 1 (one) by default. eBGP packets are dropped in transit 
if a multihop BGP session is attempted. TTL on iBGP is 255 allowing multi-hop sessions.</li>
<li>The advertising router modifies the BGP next-hop path attribute to the IP 
address sourcing the BGP connection(on eBGP routes.)</li>
<li>The advertising router prepends its ASN to the existing AS_Path.</li>
<li>The receiving router verifies that the AS_Path does not contain an ASN that matches the local router's. BGP discards
the NLRI if it fails the AS_Path loop-prevention check.
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>eBGP and iBGP Route Advertisement</h3>
<p>
It is common for the validity check to fail on external routes learned from an iBGP peer. iBGP peers do not modify the 
next-hop address if the NLRI has a next-hop address other than 0.0.0.0. The next-hop address must be resolvable in the 
global RIB in order for it to be considered valid and advertised to other BGP peers.
eBGP peering links must be installed in the RIB of intermediate iBGP peers for forwarding to occur or use an IGP between 
iBGP peers.
</p>
<p>
The BGP next-hop-self feature can be used to advertise peering links of eBGP neighbors into iBGP in address-family mode using the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; next-hop-self [all]</b></code> is used for each neighbor. The next-hop-self 
does not modify the next-hop address for iBGP prefixes by default. The <code style="font-size:120%"><b>all</b></code> keyword modifies the
next-hop for iBGP too.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R6(config-router)#<b>address-family ipv4 unicast</b><br>
R6(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor AS65000 next-hop-self</b>
</code></div>
<p>
On an iBGP peer, issuing the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast</b></code> confirms that the next hop for eBGP 
advertised links has been set to the eBGP peer.
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">

</code></div>

<h1 id="PATH_ATTRIBUTES">Path Attributes</h1>
<p>
Every prefix in a BGP update contains path attributes (PAs). Path attributes can 
be thought of as properties or characteristics of a prefix. They are used by BGP 
in the best path selection process for NLRI. Network Layer Reachability 
Information (NLRI) is a routing update that consists of the network prefix, 
prefix length and any other PAs for the specific route.
Path attributes can be modified with granularity providing complete control of 
BGP's routing policies. They serve a variety of purposes with some path attributes 
serving more than one purpose.:
<ul>
  <li>Best path selection process</li>
  <li>Loop prevention</li>
  <li>Prefix classification for further processing e.g. route tags used by BGP communities that are processed by a 
  downstream router.</li>
  <li>Informative e.g. atomic aggregate which indicates that some path information is missing due to prefix 
  summarization.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
BGP attributes are contained in every Update message except withdrawal messages.
Each attribute is a TLV that consists of attribute type, length and value. Every 
attribute is two bytes (1 byte for flags and the other for attribute details).

</p>

<h2>Types of Path Attributes</h2>
<p>
BGP prefix path attributes are classified as;
<ol>
  <li><b>Well-known mandatory:</b> Any device capable of speaking BGP has to 
  understand these attributes. Every BGP update must include these attributes. 
  These include: next-hop, AS_PATH and origin code.</li>
  <li><b>Well-known discretionary:</b> every BGP speaker should understand these 
  types of attributes. As it is discretionary, it may or may not be included with 
  every prefix advertisement.</li>
  <li><b>Optional transitive:</b> optional indicates that no devices are 
  guaranteed to understand this attribute. Transitive indicates that this path 
  attribute is permitted to transit from one autonomous system to another. 
  This is done by setting the transitive flag to "on" that results in the BGP device 
  including the path attribute in its update to eBGP peers.
  For 
  prefixes received with path attributes that are not understood, these prefixes 
  can be installed in the BGP table. 
  However, these attributes cannot be altered. Additionally, they are included 
  in any subsequent advertisement to other peers. These attributes are maintained 
  with the prefix update from autonomous system to autonomous system.</li>
  <li><b>Optional non-transitive:</b> may be proprietary. This attribute can not 
  leave the autonomous system.</li>
</ol>
All well-known mandatory path attributes are also transitive. Routers usually drop BGP updates if they do not contain 
these path attributes.
Optional attributes do not have to be recognised by all BGP implementations.
</p>

<h2>Use of Path Attributes</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites to Best Path Selection</h3>

<h4>Next Hop</h4>
<p>
Routers always select the path a packet should take by examining the prefix length, 
where the longest prefix length is always preferred. 
Path attributes could be modified as they are advertised externally to influence 
the path taken. The NEXT_HOP path attribute has a type code of 3.

In eBGP, the next hop IP is the IP address of the exit interface of an eBGP peer
that sent the update. An iBGP peer that receives NLRI from an eBGP does not 
modify the next hop attribute when sending the update to an iBGP peer. The next 
hop attribute should be thought of in the context of autonomous system to 
autonomous system instead of router to router. This approach helps in troubleshooting 
reachability issues that my arise.

in iBGP, the next hop IP address is the address of the iBGP peer that originated 
the prefix. The originator of a prefix has a next hop value of 0.0.0.0 in the 
BGP table. When advertising internal prefixes, a BGP peer should override the 
next hop value to its exit interface using the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>next-hop-self</b></code> 
keyword of the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>neighbor</b></code>.
When a router receives a BGP update, it first verifies whether the next-hop is 
reachable. If the next-hop is not reachable,
the best path selection process will not even start for the prefix. If the next hop is reachable, then the best path 
selection process starts.
</p>
<p>
BGP Next hop controls the IGP route recursion i.e. BGP knows the next-hop but 
does not know the egress interface. The IGP must perform recursion otherwise, 
the route cannot be used. The result of a failed next hop recursion is a failed 
best path selection i.e. the route is not installed in the RIB or advertised.
The next-hop validity check is to prevent a route recursion failure.
By default, outbound iBGP updates do not modify the next-hop attribute regardless 
of iBGP peer type. This can be modified using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor 
&lt;ip-address&gt; next-hop-self</b></code> or in a route-map using the action 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>set ip next-hop</b></code>. More recent IOS versions include the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>next-hop-self all</b></code> to insert the route reflector in 
the data-path. This is usually used in Unified MPLS design.
</p>
<p>
Updates sent to an iBGP peer does not modify the next hop by default. Update 
source IP address is used as the next hop.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> All BGP prefixes must pass the route validity check, and the next-hop IP address
must be resolvable for the route to be eligible as a best path. Some vendors and publications consider this as the first 
step in the BGP best path selection process.
</p>
<h5>Next-hop-self at Edge</h5>
<p>
Pros:
<ul>
  <li>Peer can use the same next-hop on outbout updates to iBGP peers.</li>
  <li>Result is same dynamic update-group.</li>
  <li>Don't need to include external links in IGP.</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
  <li>Hinders fast convergence of external uplink failure. This has to do with 
  BGP's next hop tracking; if the next hop is lost, all routes accessible through 
  the lost next hop are flushed and begins reconvergence.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>eBGP Next Hop Processing</h5>
<p>
By default, outbound eBGP updates have a local update-source for neighbor set as 
next-hop e.g. if update-source is the interface loopback0, next-hop is loopback0.
This behaviour can be modified using a route-map action <code style="font-size:120%"><b>set ip next-hop
</b></code>, <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor next-hop-unchanged</b></code>; this can be used 
for third-party next-hops.
</p>

<h4>BGP Synchronization</h4>
<p>
Synchronization rile must be met or disabled. Synchronization is a legacy black-hole 
prevention technique.
</p>
<h4>AS-Path must not contain Local-AS</h4>
<p>
Normal EBGP loop prevention. Can be disabled with <code style="font-size:120%"><b>allow-as in</b></code>.
</p>
<h4>First ASN in path must be neighbor's ASN</h4>
<p>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp enforce-first-as</b></code> command. This helps provide an added layer of 
security to BGP. For additional BGP security, see security section.
</p>

<h3> Best Path Selection</h3>
<p>
A BGP router only advertises the best path to neighboring routers.
Inside the Loc-RIB, all the prefixes and their path attributes are maintained with the best path calculated. 
The best path selection is based on multiple path attributes. The best path is presented to the RIB for installation. 
If the best path is no longer available, the BGP device can use the existing paths to quickly identify a new best path. 
BGP recalculates the best path for a prefix when the following events occur:
<ol>
  <li>Change in the next-hop or next-hop reachability of a prefix</li>
  <li>Failure of an interface connected to an eBGP peer</li>
  <li>Redistribution change</li>
  <li>Reception of new or removed paths for a network prefix.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
BGP autonomatically installs the first received path as the best path. When additional paths are received for the same 
network prefix, the newer paths are compared against the current best path. If there is a tie, processing continues until 
a best path winner is identified. The BGP best path algorithm selects the best path in this order. 
<ol>
  <li>Prefer the path with the highest weight</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the highest local preference.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path that was originated by the local router via the 
  <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>network</b></code> or <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>aggregate</b></code> commands or through 
  route redistribution from an IGP such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc. Local paths sourced 
  through the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>network</b></code> or <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>redistribute</b></code> 
  commands are preferred over local aggregated paths sourced through the command 
  <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>aggregate-address</b></code>.
  
  </li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lower Accumulated Interior Gateway Protocol (AIGP) metric.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the shortest AS_PATH.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lowest origin type. IGP is lower than external 
  gateway protocol (EGP), and EGP is lower than incomplete.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lowest Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).</li>
  <li>Prefer the external path over the internal path.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lowest IGP metric to the BGP next hop.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the oldest session for eBGP paths.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path from the BGP peer with the lowest router ID.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lowest cluster length for iBGP paths.</li>
  <li>Prefer the path with the lowest neighbor BGP router ID for iBGP peers.</li>
</ol>
Some consider the next-hop validity as the path selection criteria. This is because when a BGP device receives an update, 
it first verifies whether the next-hop is reachable. If the next-hop is not reachable, the path selection process will not 
even start for the prefix. If the next-hop is reachable, then the best path selection process starts.
</p>

<h4>Weight</h4>
<p>
Weight is a 16-bit value (0 - 65535) assigned locally on the router where the higher weight is preferred.
Weight is an optional non-transitive path attribute and therefore is not included in the update message.
BGP weight is a Cisco-defined path attribute and the first parameter checked when
selecting the best path on Cisco devices. Weight only influences outbound
traffic from a router or an autonomous system and is not advertised to peers. 
It is locally significant and is not contained in updates. 
It can be thought of in the context of the administrative distance assigned to different routing
protocols by a router. BGP peers have no idea that a local router is using weight for best path selection.
</p>
<p>
By default, locally originated prefixes have a weight value of 32768. 
For prefixes received from other BGP peers, the weight is assigned a value of zero (0).
The following sequence of steps shows the process for setting the weight of a prefix:

<h4>Local Preference</h4>
<p>
Local preference (LOCAL_PREF) is a well-known discretionary path attribute that 
indicates the preference for exiting the autonomous system to a remote prefix. 
It is 32-bit. The higher value is preferred. The local preference does not have 
to be present in a BGP update. If the value is not specified, then a default value 
of 100 is used. LOCAL_PREF is not advertised between eBGP peers as such it is 
not transitive. However, it is advertised to confederation eBGP peers in BGP 
implementations that deploy the use of BGP confederations.
It is used to influence routing decisions in the local autonomous 
system i.e. it is propagated only in the local AS.
Modifying the LOCAL_PREF can influence path selection in other iBGP peers without
affecting eBGP peers because it is not advertised outside the autonomous system.
Local preference has a type code of 5.
</p>

<p>
LOCAL_PREF can be set for specific routes with an inbound route map using the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set local-preference &lt;value&gt;</b></code>
The default local preference value can be modified from 100 to a different value 
using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp default 
local-preference &lt;&lt;0-4294967295&gt;&gt;</b></code>. 
The LOCAL PREFERENCE values can be modified to alter routing behaviour using a route map:

Before altering the Local preference on an autonomous system edge BGP device, the path taken by a downstream router is

<b>Note:</b> Changing the LOCAL_PREF can produce interesting results. If two routers having different paths to a
prefix advertise their paths, both will receive the other's prefix advertisement. However, with changed LOCAL_PREF, the 
router whose path has a lower LOCAL_PREF will send a prefix withdraw to the one with a better path. It will have two paths 
to the same prefix and the one with the better path will have one. Always remember BGP peers only share their best path.

<h4>Locally Originated</h4>
<p>

Preference is given in best path selection using the following criteria:
<ol>
  <li>Routes that were advertised locally: these are paths that were sourced 
  into the Loc-RIB table using the BGP <code style="font-size:120%"><b>network</b></code> command.</li>.
  <li>Prefer local paths that were redistributed into BGP.</li>
  <li>Networks that have been aggregated locally using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>
  aggregate-address</b></code> (summarization).</li>
  <li>Routes received by BGP peers</li>
</ol>
<b>Note:</b> prefixes injected into the BGP table using the network command and 
through redistribution are preferred to summary prefixes using the aggregate-address 
command.
</p>
<h4>Accumulated Interior Gateway Protocol (AIGP)</h4>
<p>
Accumulated Interior Gateway Protocol (AIGP) is an optional non-transitive path attribute that is included with advertisements
throughout an autonomous system. IGPs typically use metric to identify the shortest path to a destination but cannot 
provide the scalability of BGP. BGP uses the autonomous system to identify a single domain of control for a routing 
policy. BGP does not use the path metric due to scalability issues combined with the notion that each autonomous system 
may use a different policy to calculate the metrics. AIGP provides the ability for BGP to maintain and calculate a 
conceptual path metric in environments that use multiple autonomous systems with unique IGP routing domains in each 
AS. AIGP path attribute exchanges must be agreed upon between the BGP peers and AIGP metrics are only included in prefix 
advertisements between AIGP-enabled peers. AIGP metrics are enabled for a BGP neighbor with the BGP address family config
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; aigp</b></code>
</p>
<p>
The following guidelines apply to AIGP metrics:
<ul>
  <li>A path with an AIGP metric is preferred to a path without an AIGP metric.</li>
  <li>If the next-hop address requires a recursive lookup, the AIGP path needs to calculate a derived metric to include 
  the distance to the next-hop address. This ensures that the cost to the BGP edge router is included. The formula is:
  <code style="font-size:120%">Derived AIGP metric = (Original AIGP Metric + Next-Hop AIGP Metric)</code>
  <ul>
    <li>If multiple AIGP paths exist and one next-hop address contains an AIGP metric and the other does not, the non-AIGP
    path is not used.</li>
    <li>The next-hop AIGP metric is recursively added if multiple lookups are performed.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>AIGP paths are compared based on the derived AIGP metric (with recursive next hops) or the actual AIGP metric 
  (non-recursive next-hop). The path with the lower AIGP metric is preferred.</li>
  <li>When a router A advertises an AIGP-enabled path that was learned from another router B, if the next-hop 
  address changes to a router A address, router A increments the AIGP metric to reflect the distance (the IGP path metric)
  between routers A and B. 
</ul>
</p>

<h4>AS_PATH</h4>
<p>
The AS_PATH attribute is a list of the ASNs to the destination prefix. It 
typically correlates to the autonomous system hop count. A shorter AS_PATH is 
preferred over a longer AS_PATH. 
The AS_PATH is a well-known transitive and mandatory path attribute.
It has to be included in all eBGP updates. eBGP peers discard updates if they do 
not include the AS_PATH.
The AS_PATH is not prepended by iBGP peers because it can result in traffic being black-holed.
Traffic can be modified by prepending to the AS_PATH in a route-map with the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set as-path prepend &lt;last_as_number | pattern&gt;</b></code>.
<b>Tip:</b> Prepend an AS on a path that you do not want to use. <code style="font-size:120%"><b>set as-path</b></code> influences routing 
decision of downstream routers.
</p>
<p>
AS_PATH prepending on production networks should use the local autonomous system number.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> create the access control list or prefix list to identify the prefixes whose AS_PATH attribute is to be 
modified.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Configure a route-map and reference the prefix-list.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Apply the route-map on a BGP peer
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> Carry out a soft reconfiguration of the neighborship.
</p>
<p>
Some service providers block prefixes whose AS_PATH has been prepended. In such a scenario, path selection can be 
influenced using the MED.
</p>
<p>
When working with confederations, AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE (confederation AS_PATH) is not counted, and for aggregated addresses 
with multiple autonomous system numbers (ASNs) under the AS_SET portion of AS_PATH, the AS_SET counts for only one
AS_PATH entry.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The AS_PATH attribute is not considered in the best path selection process if 
the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>bgp bestpath-as-path ignore</b></code> is configured.
</p>

<h4>Origin</h4>
<p>
Origin is a well-known mandatory BGP path attribute. By default, networks that 
are advertised on Cisco routers using the network statement are set with the 
code <b>i</b> (for IGP). Redistributed networks are assigned the code <b>?</b> (incomplete)
origin attribute. 
The Origin path attribute has a type code of 1 (one). The types of origin include:
IGP (code 0), EGP, and redistributed.<br> 
(<b>TODO:</b> (1).Determine the origin code for EGP and redistributed prefixes. 
(2) Create route-map and modify the origin code).<br>

When using the origin attribute to determine the best path, the 
order of preference is;
<ol>
  <li>IGP origin (i): These prefixes enter the BGP table through the network command.</li>
  <li>Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) (e): referencing the EGP (exterior gateway 
  protocol), the predecessor to BGP.</li>
  <li>Incomplete origin (?): redistributed routes.</li>
</ol>
On Cisco IOS devices, the origin can not be set to EGP. EGP is no longer 
implemented by most network equipment vendors. The only two origins attributes 
that can be viewed will have  a value of i or ?.
</p>
<p>
A prefix's origin can be modified in a route map with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set origin &lt;igp | incomplete&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<h4>Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)</h4>
<p>
MED is a discretionary non-transitive BGP path attribute. MED's purpose is to 
influence traffic flows inbound from a different autonomous system. 
MED uses a 32-bit value called a metric. A lower MED is preferred. BGP sets the 
MED automatically to the IGP metric during network advertisement
or redistribution. If the MED is received via an eBGP session, it can be 
advertised to other iBGP peers but it should not be sent outside the autonomous 
system that received it. 
MED can be considered as a sort of suggestion sent from an eBGP peer to another 
eBGP peer to suggest to that neighbor how they enter my AS for a particular prefix.
The eBGP peers can choose to ignore the MED values when deciding the best path.
The default MED value is zero(0).
For MED to be an effective decision factor, the paths being decided upon must 
come from the same autonomous system. Any confederation sub-ASs are ignored.
The MED has a type code of 4. MED can be used as a sort of load balancing technique 
with traffic to specific prefixes using one path and traffic to other prefixes 
using another path.
</p>
<p>
RFC 4451 guidelines state that a prefix without a MED value should be given 
priority (in essence a value of zero). Cisco follows this recommendation by default. 
Some organisations require that the MED must be set and any paths without a MED 
should be treated as least preferred. If the metric is set to zero, IOS will 
advertise it to peers. The behaviour for prefixes with missing MED can be modified 
so that they are given the least preference.

Applying the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp bestpath med 
missing-as-worst</b></code> will set the MED to infinity with a value of 
4294967295 if the MED is missing from a path. The command should be placed on 
all nodes in an AS to keep the best path algorithm configuration settings the same.
</p>
<p>
The default MED comparison mechanism requires that the AS_PATH values be identical because the policies used to set the 
MED can vary from one service provider's autonomous system to another service provider's autonomous system. This means that the MED can 
influence traffic only when multiple links are from the same service provider.

Typically, organizations use different service providers for redundancy. In these 
situations, the default BGP rules for MED comparison from different service 
providers need to be relaxed to compare MED values from different service providers.
The <code style="font-size:120%"><b>always-compare-med</b></code> keyword allows 
for the comparison of MED regardless of the AS_PATH. This is 
enabled using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp 
always-compare-med</b></code>. It should be configured on all BGP routers in the 
autonomous system or a routing loop could potentially occur.
</p>
<p>
If the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>bgp bestpath med-confed</b></code> is enabled, MEDs are 
compared for all paths that consist only of AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE. These paths 
originated within the local confederation.
</p>

<h5>MED-Deterministic</h5>
<p>
The paths are stored in the order in which they are received and stored in the BGP table. If the keyword 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>always-compare-med</b></code> is not enabled, the path MED is only compared against the existing best path and 
not against all the paths in the Loc-RIB table which can cause variations in the best path comparison process.
</p>
<p>
BGP deterministic MED corrects the problem by grouping together paths with identical AS_PATH values as part of the best path 
identification process. Each group's MED is compared against the other group's MED. BGP deterministic MED is enabled 
with the configuration command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp deterministic-med</b></code>. It is recommended for all BGP deployments
in the same autonomous system.
</p>
<h5>Modification of MED</h5>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Identify the prefixes whose MED values are to be modified using a prefix list or access control list:
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Reference the identified prefixes in a route map and modify the MED values. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Implement a route refresh for outgoing BGP updates: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear ip bgp * out</b></code> 
</p>

<h4>eBGP over iBGP</h4>
<p>
The best path selection follows this order:
<ol>
  <li>eBGP peers (most desirable)</li>
  <li>Confederation member AS peers. There is no distinction between confederation 
  internal and confederation external.</li>
  <li>iBGP peers (least desirable)</li>
</ol>
The rationale behind this prioritisation is that for external prefixes, traffic 
should be routed out of the local AS rather than internally through the local AS 
to get to the external prefix.
</p>
<h4>Lowest IGP Metric</h4>
<p>
Use the lowest IGP metric/cost to reach the BGP next-hop address. Lower metric 
value is preferred. This path attribute is relevant to best path selection in iBGP.
Can use multi-path of all equal after this step. There is a command to allow 
multipath if AS_PATH is not the same (has to be same length): <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp 
best-path as-path multipath-relax</b></code>.
</p>
<h4>Oldest eBGP Path</h4>
<p>
BGP maintains stability in a network by preferring the path from the oldest (established) BGP session. This ensures stability
in the network because unstable sessions result in the BGP best-path calculation executing frequently which consumes CPU
processing. The downfall of this technique is that it does not lead to a deterministic method of identifying the BGP best 
path from a design perspective.
</p>

<h4>Lowest Router ID</h4>
<p>
Prefer the path from the BGP peer with the lowest router ID. If a path contains 
route reflector (RR) attributes, the originator ID is substituted for the router 
ID in the best path selection process.
</p>

<h4>Minimum Cluster Length</h4>
<p>
Select the best path using the lowest cluster list length. This is specifically 
for iBGP routes. This directly refers to the number of route reflectors that the 
prefix transits. The cluster list is a non-transitive BGP path attribute that is
appended (not overwritten) by a route reflector with its cluster ID. Route 
reflectors use cluster ID attribute as a loop prevention mechanism. This cluster 
ID is not advertised between autonomous systems and is locally significant. In simplest terms, this step locates the path that has travelled the lowest number of 
iBGP advertisement hops.
</p>
<h4>Lowest Neighbor Address</h4>
<p>
Select the path that comes from the lowest BGP neighbor address. This step is limited to iBGP peerings because eBGP 
peerings used the oldest received path as the tie-breaker.
</p>

<h3>Exceptions to the Best Path Selection</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>AS-Path:</b> <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp bestpath as-path ignore</b></code></li>
  <li><b>MED:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp always-compare-med</b></code></li>
      <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp bestpath med-confed</b></code>: compares MED for routes locally originated in 
      the confederation</li>
      <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp bestpath med-missing-as-worst</b></code>: assigns MED of 
      4294967294 to NULL MED.</li>
      <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp deterministic med</b></code>: Compare MED against all possible 
      paths.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>IGP Metric:</b> <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp bestpath igp-metric ignore</b></code>. This 
  was introduced in IOS-XE3.4s</li>
  <li><b>Router-ID:</b> <code style="font-size:120%"><b>no bgp bestpath compare-routerid</b></code>.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Manipulating Best Path Selection</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Outbound routing policy affects inbound traffic</li>
  <li>Inbound routing policy affects outbound traffic</li>
  <li>Longest match routing is above all: affects both directions.
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Attributes Influencing Outbound Path Selection</h4>
<p>
Weight and local-preference: set inbound and affects outbound traffic.
</p>

<h4>Attributes Influencing Inbound Path Selection</h4>
<p>
AS-Path and MED: set outbound but affects inbound traffic.
</p>

<h3>Multipath Load Balancing</h3>
<p>
Multipath load balancing for external links with unequal bandwidth capacity; 
enabled under IPv4, IPv6, VPNv4 and VRF address families as well as for iBGP, 
eBGP, eiBGP. However, still only one best path is advertised to peers. 
</p>


<h2>Loop Prevention</h2>
<p>
In addition of being used in best path selection, the AS_Path attribute is used 
for loop prevention.
</p>
<h3>AS_Path</h3>
<p>
AS_Path is a well-known mandatory attribute and includes a complete list of all 
ASNs that the prefix advertisement has traversed from its source AS. 
The source autonomous 
system is the furthest to the right of the AS_Path attribute and the most recent 
to the left. AS_Path is used as a loop prevention mechanism in BGP. If a BGP router 
receives a prefix advertisement with its AS listed in the AS_Path attribute, 
it discards the prefix because the router thinks the advertisement forms a loop. 
This behaviour can be modified using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; 
allowas-in</b></code> or <code style="font-size:120%"><b>as-override</b></code>.
</p>

<h1 id="BGP_ECMP">BGP Equal-Cost Multipath</h1>
<p>
BGP advertises only one best path but it allows for the installation of multiple
paths into the RIB. BGP supports only equal-cost multipaths and unequal cost 
multipathing through the configuration of BGP Link Bandwidth. BGP multipathing 
has three different variances in behaviour: eBGP multipath, iBGP multipath, eBGP 
and iBGP multipath (eiBGP). This is traditionally used in service providers with 
Layer 3 VPNs. Enabling BGP multipathing does not alter  the best-path algorithm 
or change the behaviour of paths advertisement to other BGP peers. Only the BGP 
best path is advertised to peers.
</p>

<p>
To become a candidate for multipath, paths to the same destination, the following 
path attributes need to have the same values:
<ul>
  <li>Origin</li>
  <li>AS PATH length</li>
  <li>Neighboring As or sub-AS (in the case of confederations)</li>
  <li>Weight</li>
  <li>MED</li>
  <li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>eBGP Equal Cost Multipath</h2>
<p>
eBGP multipath is enabled  on IOS routers with the address-family command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>maximum-paths &lt;number&gt;&gt;</b></code>.
eBGP paths to qualify for multipath need to match the best path path attributes: 
<ul>
 <li>Weight</li> 
  <li>Local Preference</li>
  <li>AS Path length</li>
  <li>AS_Path content (although confederations can contain a different 
  AS_CONFED_SEQ path)</li> 
  <li>Origin</li>
  <li>MED</li>
  <li>The IGP metric to the BGP next hop must be equal to the best path IGP metric.</li>
  <li>The path should have been learned from an eBGP peer or confederation external peer.</li>
  </ul>
  If the do not, they are not eligible.

<h2>iBGP Multipath</h2>
<p>
iBGP multipath is enabled with the address-family command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>maximum-paths ibgp &lt;number&gt;</b></code>. 
To become candidate for iBGP multipath, iBGP paths need to match the best path 
path attributes: 
<ul>
  <li>Weight</li>
  <li>Local Preference</li>
  <li>AS Path length</li>
  <li>AS_Path content (although confederations can contain a different 
  AS_CONFED_SEQ path)</li> 
  <li>Origin</li>
  <li>MED</li>
  <li>IGP metric to the BGP next hop must be equal to the best path IGP metric, 
  unless the router is configured for unequal cost iBGP multipath.</li>
  <li>The path must have been received from an iBGP peer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>eiBGP MultiPath</h2>
<p>
eiBGP multipath is configured using the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>maximum-paths eibgp</b></code>.
</p>


<h1 id="iBGP_SCALABILITY">iBGP Scalability</h1>
<p>
In a bid to prevent the formation of loops, prefixes received from an iBGP peer 
cannot be advertised to another iBGP peer. To scale iBGP so that prefixes are 
advertised across the autonomous-system to other iBGP peers, the following 
options are available: full-mesh configuration, route reflectors and BGP confederations.
You do not have to select one design over another; one implementation would 
consist of a full mesh in one section of the network for path diversity and 
inter-cluster route reflectors for scaling in another section of the network.
</p>
<p>
Both route reflection and confederations accomplish the same goal; iBGP scalability.
Migration to a confederation is more complicated, however, greenfield confederation 
is easier. Migration to route reflection is easier. 
</p>

<h2>iBGP Full Mesh</h2>
<p>
iBGP peers do not prepend their ASN to the AS-Path because the NLRI would fail the validity check and would not install 
the prefix into the Loc-RIB and RIB. iBGP rules prohibit the advertisement of an NLRI received from an iBGP peer to 
another iBGP peer. This is how iBGP prevents the formation of loops. In order to maintain a loop-free topology without 
traffic blackholing in iBGP, one technique is to configure all iBGP peers to form  a full-mesh neighborship with each other.
A full mesh is required to be created so 
that iBGP peers can overcome this split-horizon restriction. 

</p>
<p>
Full mesh design advantages:
<ul>
  <li>Path diversity: all BGP peers learn all possible egress paths.</li>
  <li>Optimal traffic flows: all BGP peers learn the closest egress path. Path 
  selection, by default, would be based on IGP metric to the egress router i.e. 
  hot potato routing.</li>
  
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The configuration of a full-mesh iBGP peering in a large autonomous system is a monstrous task and is not a recommended 
best practice. However, the use of peer groups can help reduce the administrative challenge of a full-mesh iBGP network.
Key disadvantages of full mesh designs include the following:
<ul>
  <li>Control plane scaling is exponential: the number of peerings for a full mesh 
  is determined by the formula <code style="font-size:120%">n * (n - 1) &divide; 2</code>.
  Given 10 routers = 45 peerings, 100 routers = 4950 peerings.</li>
  <li>Operationally hard to scale: adding or modifying peering configuration is 
  administratively prohibitive.</li>
</ul>
</p>

Route reflectors enable iBGP peers to advertise prefixes without the need to form full-mesh iBGP neighborships.
Route reflectors are configured per address family; a route reflector for the IPv4 
address family will not act as a route reflector for the IPv6 address family 
unless it is configured for this purpose.

Route reflectors are defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1966.txt">
RFC 1966</a> and updated by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4456">
RFC 4456</a>. Through route reflectors, BGP devices are able to advertise prefixes to iBGP 
peers by "reflecting" the prefixes; RR only reflects its best path. The BGP 
device that is reflecting prefixes is known as a <b>route reflector(RR)</b>.
Route reflection eliminates the need for full mesh. iBGP peers only need to peer 
with the route reflector. This is similar in context to the operation of the OSPF 
designated router(DR) where updates are sent to the RR which then sends the update 
to route reflector clients. The RR does not modify other attributes when reflecting 
routes.
The BGP device that is receiving reflected prefixes is referred to as a <b>route reflector client(RRC)</b>. 
A route reflector will not modify the next-hop ip address for the routes that are advertised from iBGP peers.
Route reflectors are guided by three rules:
<ol>
  <li><b>Rule 1: </b>If route reflector receives a prefix from a BGP peer that is not a route reflector client, 
  the route reflector advertises the prefixes to a route reflector client. It does not advertise the prefixes to a 
  non-route reflector client.</li>
  <li><b>Rule 2: </b>If a route reflector receives a prefix from a route reflector client, it advertises the prefixes to 
  route reflector clients and non-route reflector clients.</li>
 <li><b>Rule 3: </b>If a route reflector receives a prefix from an eBGP peer. It advertises the prefix to route reflector 
 clients and non-route reflector clients.</li> 
</ol>
</p>
<p>
BGP Route reflection is a BGP policy command and so it is configured under the 
address-family and is configured only on route reflector devices with the 
address-family command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address | peer-group-name&gt; 
route-reflector-client</b></code>. 
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">

R2(config-router-af#<b>neighbor AS65000 route-reflector-client</b>
</code>
</div>
<p>
No further BGP configuration is applied to route-reflector clients. Unlike implementation 
of BGP confederations, implementing route reflectors does not affect the existing 
BGP sessions.
</p>
<p>
Both MuED and IGP metrics may impact the BGP route selection... with certain 
route relection technologies the route reflection approach may not yield the 
same route selection result as that of the full iBGP mesh approach. A way to make 
route selection the same..[is] by configuring the intra-cluster IGP metrics to be 
better than the inter-cluster IGP metrics, and maintaining full mesh within the 
cluster i.e. full mesh and route reflectors together.
</p>
<p>
Route reflectors are the very critical devices when implementing iBGP scalability 
using route reflection. It is important that they have accurate information as 
they are the principle source of path information for other iBGP devices. 
Path attribute modification should be implemented on the route reflectors.
</p>

<p>
A route reflector can have three types of peers:
<ul>
  <li>eBGP peers</li>
  <li>iBGP client peers</li>
  <li>iBGP non-client peers</li>
</ul>
Route reflectors process updates differently depending on what type of peer they 
came from:
<ul>
  <li>eBGP learning routes: pass to eBGP peers, clients and non-clients</li>
  <li>Client learned routes: pass to eBGP peers, clients and non-clients</li>
  <li>Non-client learned routes: pass to eBGP peers and clients</li>
</ul>
The placement of the RR in the topology should be guided by these rules.
</p>

<h3>Developments in BGP</h3>
<p>
In more recent BGP topologies, virtual route reflectors are gaining prominence. 
These virtual route reflectors are usually virtual machines and share NLRI information 
in the autonomous system.
</p>
<p>
In iBGP topologies with route reflectors, the BGP selective route download has 
exists. This feature allows a network administrator to selectively download some 
or none of the BGP routes into the RIB. The primary application for this feature 
is to suppress the unnecessary downloading of certain BGP routes to the RIB or FIB on 
a dedicated route reflector, which propagates BGP updates without carrying 
transit traffic. The feature thereby helps to maximize resources available and 
to improve routing scalability and convergence on the dedicated route reflector.
This is useful if the dedicated route reflector does not have sufficient hardware
 resources

<h3>High Availability</h3>
<p>
A simple BGP topology with a single route reflector may not provide the high-availability requirement of autonomous 
systems. High availability can be provided by adding redundant route reflectors, nested route reflectors where route 
reflector clients are route reflectors themselves. These different route reflectors 
will have different route reflector IDs.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Route Reflector Loop Prevention</h3>
<p>
Route reflection relaxes the iBGP restrictions of loop prevention by permitting the advertisement of a prefix received 
from an iBGP peer to another iBGP peer. The design of route reflection poses a 
great risk of introducing routing loops. 
Nested route reflection with intra-cluster loops occuring on peerings between 
route reflector clients and inter-cluster loops occuring in connections between 
route reflector clients peering with route reflector clients of different route reflector clusters. 
</p>
<p>
Route reflectors prevent loop formation by the use of the cluster-ID; an RR discards 
routes received with its own cluster-ID. Additionally, 
o prevent routing loop formation in iBGP, route reflectors sets the <b>ORIGINATOR_ID</b>
attribute to the router-ID of the RR client on prefixes received from route reflector 
client. The client uses Originator-ID for loop prevention. 
Together with the and <b>CLUSTER_LIST</b> path attribute, these two path attributes 
are used to guard against inter-cluster and 
intra-cluster loops from being formed. The ORIGINATOR_ID has a type code of 9 and 
CLUSTER_LIST has a type code of 10.
</p>
<p>
The CLUSTER_ID can be set manually using the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp cluster-id &lt;cluster-id&gt;</b></code> where the cluster 
ID is a 32-bit quantity in the range 1 - 4294967294 or in the form of an IPv4 address.
The cluster IDs can be viewed using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast 
cluster-ids</b></code>
</p>
<p>
The following Wireshark capture of a BGP update packet shows the 
ORIGINATOR_ID and the CLUSTER_ID path attributes added to a prefix.

<h4>ORIGINATOR_ID</h4>
<p>
The ORIGINATOR_ID is an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that is created 
by the first route reflector. Its value is set to the router ID of the BGP device
that advertised the route into the autonomous system. If a prefix contains an 
ORIGINATOR_ID path attribute, this value is not to be overwritten. The 
ORIGINATOR_ID path attribute can be verified by issuing the
command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast &lt;ip-address&gt;</b></code>

If a route reflector receives a prefix with its CLUSTER ID in the CLUSTER_LIST attribute, the prefix will be discarded 
because it has been looped. The CLUSTER_LIST path attribute can be verified by the command:

<h3>Large Scale Route Reflection</h3>
<p>
Large scale BGP designs should not be serviced by a single RR. RR clusters allow 
redundancy and hierarch. A cluster is defined by the clients an RR serves. RRs 
in the same cluster use the same cluster-ID. Per address-family RR pairs; this 
avoids the "fate sharing" of services.
</p>
<h4>Inter-cluster Peerings</h4>
<p>
Inter-cluster peerings between RRs can be client for non-client peerings; depending  
on redundancy design, there could be duplicate routes and more processing. However, 
loops are prevented by the cluster-ID. The cluster-ID is based on the Router-ID; 
by default, all route reflectors are in separate cluster. If the same cluster-ID 
is used on both clusters (i.e. both RRs), then they may not accept each other's 
updates.
</p>
<h3>Virtual Route Reflectors</h3>
<p>
RRs generally does not need to be in the data path. A high memory/CPU VM can 
serve as a RR. IOS-XRv, CSR1000v and Quagga can be used as virtual RRs. With 
virtual RR, there's no need to install the 900K+ routes in the RIB/FIB if the 
RR is not in the data path. The selective RIB download feature can be considered:
<ul>
  <li>It prevents BGP paths from being installed in the RIB/FIB.</li>
  <li>It is implemented using the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>table-map [route-map] filter</b></code>.
  <li>Scales to 20m+ VPNv4 routes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="CONFEDERATIONS">Confederations</h2>
<p>
BGP confederations are another alternative to full iBGP mesh implementing iBGP 
scalability. Defined by RFC 3065, BGP confederations split the autonomous system 
into smaller sub-autonomous systems known as member autonomous systems that combine into a larger 
autonomous system known as autonomous system confederation. 
Inside the sub-AS, full mesh or RR can be implemented. The peering between BGP 
routers in different sub-ASs acts like eBGP.
eBGP peers have no knowledge that they are peering with a confederation and they reference the 
confederation identifier in their configuration. 
Confederations can be further scaled by performing route reflection inside a confederation.
When advertising to eBGP peers, sub-AS numbers are stripped from the updates.
</p>
<p>
Confederations are configured using private autonomous system numbers i.e. 
64512 - 65534. 
Different IGPs can be configured in each sub-AS with <code style="font-size:120%"><b>next-hop-self</b></code> 
command configured on the Sub-AS border routes. 
Confederation eBGP peerings are created between each of the 
confederations. Confederation eBGP peering does not follow the all same rules of standard eBGP.
Some changes occur in the operation of confederation eBGP peerings such as: 
<ul>
  <li>BGP MED attribute is transitive to all other member ASs but does not leave the confederation.</li>
  <li>The LOCAL_PREF attribute is transitive to all other member autonomous systems but does not leave the confederation.</li>
  <li>The next-hop address for external confederation routes does not change as the route is exchanged between member 
  autonomous systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To configure a BGP confederation:
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1: </b>Initialize the BGP process with the global configuration command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>router bgp &lt;member_asn&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R4(config)#<b>router bgp 65000</b><br>
R4(config-router)#<b>bgp router-id 4.4.4.4</b>
</code></div>
<p>
<b>Step 2: </b>Identify the BGP confederation with the command  
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp confederation identifier</b></code>.
The AS number will be known to external BGP peers i.e. peers not part of the confederation.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R4(config-router)#<b>bgp confederation identifier 112</b>
</code></div>
<p>
<b>Step 3: </b> On routers that directly peer with another member AS, identify the peering member AS with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp confederation peers &lt;member_asn&gt;</b></code>.
Configure BGP confederation peers as normal and then follow the normal BGP configuration guidelines for the remaining 
configuration.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R4(config-router)#<b>bgp confederation peers 65500 64512</b>
</code></div>
<p>
Entering the wrong confederation peers for a BGP peer in a different sub-confederation results in the following 
BGP notification messages and BGP adjacency change messages:

<h2 id="COMMUNITIES">BGP Communities</h2>
<p>
BGP's implementation of a route-tag. BGP has not route-tag matching or setting 
support. BGP Communities are used to group prefixes together for...1) advertisement 
policy 2)filtering policy 3)best path selection policy.
</p>
<p>
BGP communities are an optional transitive BGP attribute that can traverse from 
autonomous system to autonomous system. 
A BGP community is a 32-bit value that can be included with a prefix in an update. 
By default, BGP communities are not included in BGP updates. It is a recommended 
best practice to enable the sending of BGP communities to peers during BGP configuration.
BGP communities provide the capability to tag routes as well as 
modifying BGP routing policy on upstream and downstream BGP devices. BGP communities can be used to add common policies
to large groups of prefixes. A custom BGP community value can be applied to a group of prefixes and 
subsequently, a policy can be set on any prefix that possesses that custom BGP community value.
When prefixes are identified by tagging using a BGP community attribute, some policy can then be applied to these prefixes.
One prefix can have many community values attached resulting in many actions taken on a prefix when the community values  
are evaluated. 
</p>

<p>
BGP communities can be named and these names are locally significant i.e. within the autonomous system. However, 
by default, BGP communities are not advertised to BGP peers. The scope of the BGP 
community attribute can also be structured to be meaningful to a set of autonomous systems. 
</p>
<p>
There are two types of BGP communities: standard and extended.
Standard BGP communities are further classified as well-known and private communities.
<ul>
  <li><b>Well-known communities: </b>all routers that are capable of sending or receiving BGP communities must 
  implement well-known BGP communities.</li>
  <li><b>Private communities: </b> community patterns can vary from organisation to organisation. BGP private 
  communities do not need to be registered. They can be used for varying purposes in different autonomous systems; in one 
  autonomous system, a specific BGP private community value can be used to signify geographic locations while 
  in another autonomous system, it may signify a method of route advertisement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A BGP community can be displayed in different formats:
<ol>
  <li>Full 32-bit number now referred to as older format and can be displayed in decimal (0 - 4294967200) or 
  Hex 0x0 - 0xFFFFFFA0. This format is not commonly used nowadays.</li>
  <li>Two 16-bit numbers i.e. (0 - 65535) commonly referred to as new format. This new format is usually 
  represented in the form AA:NN where AA is the autonomous system number and NN is any number that can be used to 
  represent a specific routing policy in the autonomous system. This may require documentation with some sort of 
  code book that guides on what the number correlates to and the policy description 
  of that policy. This can be contrasted with well-known communities that are 
  known by their names i.e. No_Export, Local AS, No_Advertise.
  BGP communities can be displayed in new format using the global configuration command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip bgp-community new-format</b></code>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
community values are denoted in decimal according to RFC 1997 by default. To display 
communities in AA:NN format use #ip bgp new-format or ip bgp-community new-format.

<b>Setting Communities</b> 
To set communities in a route-map: 
#set community {community-number [additive] [well-knonw-community] | none}. 
Not additive by default. Can delete a community by setting to none in a route-map.
</p>
<p>
<b>Matching communities</b> match occurs via community list: <br>Define list<br>
standard list matches community name or number: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip community-list 1 
standard permit no-export</b></code>. <br>
Expanded matches regular expression: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip community-list expanded AS100 
permit 100:[0-9]+</b></code>.<br>
Reference from a route-map: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>match community AS100</b></code>.
</p>

<p>
BGP communities can be appended, removed, or modified selectively on each 
attribute as a prefix is advertised from device to device. Additionally, one 
prefix can have many BGP communities added.
</p>

<p>
Communities are enabled on a neighbor-by-neighbor basis with the BGP address-family configuration command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; send-community [standard | extended | both]</b></code>.
If a keyword is not specified, standard communities are sent by default. Without configuration of this command, the BGP 
community path attribute is not included in BGP Update packets for affected prefixes.

<h3>Well-Known Communities</h3>
<p>
RFC 1997 defined a set of global communities (known as well-known communities) that use the community range 
4,294,901,760 (0xFFFF0000) to 4,294,967,295 (0xFFFFFFFF). All routers that are capable of interpreting BGP 
communities must implement well-known communities. 

The following are the common well-known communities: Internet, No_Advertise, No_Export, Local-AS
</p>
<h4>INTERNET</h4>
<p>
Advertise the prefix to any BGP peer.
</p>

<h4>NO_ADVERTISE (0xFFFFFF02)</h4>
<P>
All routes received carrying a communities attribute containing this value MUST 
NOT be advertised to other BGP peers.
The No-Advertise community indicates that prefixes should not be advertised to 
any BGP peer. The No_Advertise BGP community can be advertised from an upstream 
BGP peer or locally with an inbound policy. The No-Advertise community is set in the 
BGP Loc-RIB that affects outbound route advertisement. The No-Advertise community
is set in a route-map with the command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>set community no-advertise</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
BGP routes that are set with the No_Advertise community can be displayed with the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast community no-advertise</b></code>.
</p>
<h4>NO_EXPORT (0xFFFFFF01)</h4>
<P>
All routes received carrying a communities attribute containing this value MUST 
NOT be advertised outside a BGP confederation boundary (a stand-alone autonomous
system that is not part of a confederation should be considered a confederation itself).

The No-Export community prevents the advertisement of a route to any eBGP peer. 
If the router receiving the No-Export route is a confederation member, the route 
can be advertised to other sub autonomous systems in the confederation.
It can also be used to affect the propagation of a prefix by a neighboring AS; 
particularly if the local AS eBGP device sends an update message with the NO_EXPORT 
community set.

The No-Export community is set with the command in a route map
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set community no-export</b></code>
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">

<h4>NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED (0xFFFFFF03)</h4>
<p>
All routes received carrying a communities attribute
containing this value MUST NOT be advertised to external BGP
peers (this includes peers in other members autonomous
systems inside a BGP confederation).
</p>
<p>
The No-Export sub confed community known as the Local-AS community prevents the advertisement of a route outside of the 
local autonomous system. If the router receiving a route with the Local-AS community is a confederation member, the route 
can be advertised only within the Sub-AS (member-AS) and is not advertise between member autonomous systems. The Local-AS 
community is set within a route map with the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set community local-as</b></code>
</p>
<p>
The command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast community local-as</b></code> shows all the BGP prefixes that contain the Local-AS community
</p>
<h3>Private Communities</h3>
<p>
Community patterns can vary from organisation to organisation. It does not need to be registered and can signify 
geographic locations for one autonomous system while signifying a method of route advertisement in another autonomous 
system. 
</p>
<p>
Two simple concepts are involved with private communities:
<ol>
  <li>Conditionally matching a prefix by community</li>
  <li>Setting private BGP communities.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Conditionally-Matching Communities</h3>
<p>
Conditionally matching BGP communities allows for selection of routes based on the BGP communities within the routes 
path attributes so that selective processing can occur in route maps. You display the entire BGP table by using the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast detail</b></code> and then manually select a route with a specific community. 
However, if the BGP community is known, you can display all the routes by using the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp &lt;ipv4 unicast&gt; community &lt;community&gt;</b></code>.

</p>
<p>
Conditionally matching requires the creation of a community list. A community list shares a similar structure to an ACL.
It can be standard or expanded. The community list can be referenced by a number or name. Standard community lists are 
numbered 1 to 99 and match either well-known communities or a private community number i.e. (AS-number:16-bit number).
Expanded community lists are numbered 100 to 500 and use regex patterns. The configuration syntax for a community list is:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip community-list [1-500 | standard &lt;list_name&gt; | expanded &lt;list_name&gt;&gt;] [permit | deny] &lt;community_pattern&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
Community patterns can be one or multiple entries. If multiple communities are listed in the same entry, then all items 
must match i.e. considered a boolean AND. If a boolean OR function is desired, then just add multiple lines to the community
list so that it is entered as a second Access Control Entity. The community list is then referenced in a route-map with 
the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>match community [1 - 500]</b></code>
</p>
<p>
A private BGP community can be set in a route-map by using the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>set community &lt;bgp_community&gt; [additive]</b></code>
By default, when you set a community, any existing communities are overwritten, but you can preserve them by using the 
optional additive keyword.
</p>

<h3>Extended Communities</h3>
<p>
Extended communities have a 64-bit length. It has a type value approach. Extended 
communities can be set for transitive or non-transitive capability. A common use of 
extended communities is for MPLS L3VPN specifically for route target (RT) community 
value for example: #route-target both 65535:4294967295, MPLS L2VPN, EIGRP Cost Community.
</p>
<h3>BGP Cost-Community</h3>
<p>
BGP custom decision process. Only advertised within the AS or to confederation 
peers. Influences BGP path selection at the point of insertion.: pre-bestpath 
point of insertion can be used and compares cost-community value before weight.

EIGRP as PE/CE protocol uses "pre-bestpath" cost community to encode composite metric into BGP.
</p>
<h3>GHUT Community</h3>
<p>
Graceful BGP session shutdown. Used in conjunction with graceful restart. Takes 
the restarting peer out of the data-path by modifying local preference; similar to IS-IS overload or OSPF 
Max metric LSA.
Introduced on Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6S
</p>

<h3>Using BGP Communities to Influence Best Path Selection</h3>
<p>
RFC 1998 provides guidelines for the application of the BGP community attribute 
in multihome routing and how to influence best path selection. The general idea 
is to prestage an inbound policy (using a route-map) to:
<ul>
  <li>Match on pre-defined communities</li>
  <li>Set Local preference</li>
  <li>Set other attributes</li>
</ul>
The result is that outbound community signaling affects outbound path selection 
on the other side. The appropriate LOCAL_PREFERENCE value is combined with the 
ASN in a community value e.g. ASN 100 and desired local pref of 90 results in 
a community value of 100:90.
</p>
<p>
To implement this feature, configure a community list:
<ol>
  <li>Configure community-lists:<code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip community-list 1 permit 100:90</b></code> and 
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip community-list 2 permit 100:110</b></code>.</li>
  <li>Configure a route-map: see picture for outbound policy. For inbound policy:
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>
  #route-map BGP_IN<br>
  #match community 1<br>
  set local-preference 90<br>
  match community 2<br>
  set local-community 110<br>
  route-map BGP_IN 30
  </b></code></li>
  <li>Apply the route-map to the neighbor: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor 155.1.37.7 route-map 
  BGP_IN in</b></code> (on router R3).</li>
  <li>To view the community values easier, in global mode,<code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip bgp-community 
  new-format</b></code>.
</ol>
</p>


<h1 id="OPTIMIZATION">BGP Optimization</h1>

<h2 id="SUMMARIZATION">Route Summarization</h2>
<p>
BGP auto-summary is disabled by default. It automatically summarizes prefixes on 
classful boundaries, no mask required on the network statemetn and requires 
subnet of network to be present in the IGP.
</p>
<p>
<b>BGP aggregation:</b><br>
BGP hierarchy is arbitrary: path vector is like distance vector i.e. you learn 
from your neighbor. OSPF and IS-IS is strict leaf-spine-leaf. Imples summarization 
can apply anywhere: only requirement is that subnet must exist in BGP table.
</p>
<p>
Network prefix summarization is extremely important with BGP due to the large 
number of network prefixes that BGP can hold. The Internet routing table has 
over 950,000+ IPv4 prefixes. Summarization conserves router resources and accelerates
best path calculation by reducing the size of the BGP table on downstream routers. 
Summarization provides the benefit of stability  by hiding route flaps from 
downstream routers thereby reducing routing churn. Route summarization can reduce 
the size of the BGP table for Internet routers. The aggregated prefixes on the 
Internet reduce the routing table to 560,000 prefixes.
</p>
<p>
Two techniques exist for BGP route summarization: static and dynamic route summarization.
<ul>
<li><b>Static:</b> create a static route (point to interface null0 for loop 
prevention) for the prefix and advertise that prefix with the network statement.</li>
<li><b>Dynamic:</b> configure an aggregation network prefix. When valid component 
routes are present in the Loc-RIB, the router will create an aggregate prefix.
 Dynamic aggregation uses the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>aggregate-address 
 &lt;network&gt; &lt;subnetmask&gt; [summary-only] [as-set]</b></code>. For routes 
 to be aggregated, they must be in the BGP table and not only in the routing table.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In both methods, a new network prefix with a shorter prefix length is advertised 
into BGP. Because the aggregated prefix is a new route, the summarizing router 
is the originator for the new aggregate route. Route aggregation does not 
suppress the component routes by default. The <code style="font-size:120%"><b>summary-only</b></code>
keyword is required to suppress the component prefixes. The suppressed component 
prefixes have a status code of 's' for suppressed. 

If component prefixes 
need to be advertised to some neighbors and not others, then do not use 
 <code style="font-size:120%"><b>summary-only</b></code> but filter the component 
 prefix advertisement using a route filter.
</p>
<p>
Command Arguments:
<ul>
  <li>summary-only: suppress more specific routes</li>
  <li>suppress-map: suppress subset of more specific routes</li>
  <li>as-set: un-order list of AS numbers and communities are associated with the 
  aggregate; inherited from more specific routes.</li>
  <li>Advertise-map: attributes of prefix or prefixes matched with advrtised-map 
  are inherited in aggregate address</li>
  <li>Used in conjunction with as-set: prevents a specific AS from being included 
  in the AS_SET of the new aggregate. and circumvents loop prevention.</li>
  <li>attribute-map|route-map: used to modify attributes associated with aggregate 
  address. Used in conjunction with as-set: Can set or remove attributes e.g. remove 
  no-export community, add MED.</li>
  <li>unsuppress-map: selectively advertises prefixes that were previously suppressed 
  by aggregate-address.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Aggregated prefixes act like new BGP routes with a shorter prefix length. BGP 
path attributes like AS_PATH, MED and BGP communities are not included in the 
new BGP summary advertisement  by default. A new path attribute is added to the 
summary prefix known as atomic aggregate. The atomic aggregate path attribute 
indicates that loss of path information has occurred during summarization.
</p>
<p>
To inject the original BGP path information from the component routes, the 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>as-set</b></code> keyword is required. AS_PATH settings get copied into
the AS_Set portion of AS_PATH of the aggregate prefix from smaller component routes.
The new AS_PATH, which is included in brackets only counts as one hop.
</p>

<h3>Atomic Aggregate Attribute</h3>
<p>
When a BGP router summarizes a route, it does not advertise the AS_PATH information
from before the aggregation. The atomic aggregate attribute indicates that a 
loss of path information has occurred such as AS_PATH. The atomic aggregate 
attribute has a type code of 6.
</p>

<h3>AS_SET</h3>
<p>
To keep the BGP path information history, the optional <code style="font-size:120%"><b>as-set </b></code> 
keyword may be used with the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>aggregate-address</b></code> command. 
As the router generates the aggregate route, BGP attributes from the component 
aggregate routes are copied over to it. The AS_PATH settings from the original 
prefixes are stored in the AS_SET portion of AS_PATH. AS_SET, which is displayed 
within brackets, counts as only one AS hop, even if multiple ASs are listed.

<h2 id="FILTERING">Route Filtering</h2>
<p>
BGP update filtering occurs on a per peer basis. 
Cisco IOS provides the following  methods of filtering routes: distribute-lists, 
prefix-list, filter-lists, and Route Maps. Filtering is implemented at inbound 
route policy state for incoming prefixes and outbound routing policy stage for 
outgoing updates. It is recommended to use a route-map to avoid an order of 
operations issue where for example a distribute-list and filter-list are applied 
to the same peer and it is not clear which is implemented first.
</p>

<h3>Distribute-list</h3>
<p>
Distribute-lists allow for the filtering of network prefixes on a neighbor-by-neighbor 
basis using standard or extended Access Control Lists (ACLs). They are configured 
in address-family mode: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; 
distribute-list &lt;acl&gt; [in | out]</b></code>

<b>Note:</b> Extended ACLs in BGP behave differently; the destination section 
maps to the prefix and the source section of the ACL maps to the subnet mask.
Example: Given the following prefix 100.100.100.0/24; to filter a prefix that 
begins with exactly 100.100 higher order bits, and the prefix length is 16-bits 
or greater, we permit the entry and block everything else:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>#access-list 100 permit ip 100.100.0.0 0.0.255.255 255.255.0.0 0.0.255.255</b></code>.
</p>
<h3>Prefix-List</h3>
<p>
Prefix-lists allow the filtering of network prefixes on a neighbor-by-neighbor 
basis for a specific direction i.e. inbound or outbound. 
Compared to the access control lists, prefix-lists provide more fine-grained filtering.
In address-family mode; <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; prefix-list 
&lt;prefix-list-name&gt; [in | out]</b></code>
</p>
<p>
The example of the extended ACL can be easily implemented using a prefix-list as 
follows: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip prefix-list MYLIST permit 100.100.0.0/16 ge 24</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
The following steps guide with configuration of filtering using prefix-lists. The BGP device aggregates 
local prefixes but filters the more specific local prefixes from being advertised to an eBGP peer.

<b>Step 1:</b> Create a prefix list
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R1(config)#<b>ip prefix-list PL_10.1.0.0/17 seq 10 deny 10.1.0.0/17 le 32</b><br>
R1(config)#<b>ip prefix-list PL_10.1.0.0/17 seq 20 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32</code></b>
</code></div>

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Apply the prefix-list in routing policy on the BGP peer.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R1(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor 9.9.9.9 prefix-list PL_10.1.0.0/17 out</b>
</code></div>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Reset the BGP neighborship.
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R1(config-router-af)#<b>do clear bgp ipv4 unicast 9.9.9.9 out</b>
</code></div>
<p>
The Loc-RIB table of R1 and R9 after applying filtering using the prefix-list shows that prefixes 10.1.10.0/24, 
10.1.11.0/24, 10.1.12.0/24. The aggregated prefix 10.1.0.0/16 is permitted by the prefix list and is therefore not 
filtered. 
</p>
<p>
This may be an effective method of advertising aggregated prefixes to eBGP peers and filtering the component prefixes 
but advertising the component prefixes to iBGP peers as they are internal to the organization.

<h3>Outbound Route Filters (ORF)</h3>
<p>
In traditional filtering model, upstream provider will send full BGP table, a default only,
default plus local routes. Normally, some complex view is not maintained. 
Inbound route filtering on the downstream neighbor is inefficient because we 
must receive the full view and process it via BGP before any filtering e.g. if 
we are interested in just 100 NLRI, we will still receive all the 900K routes 
and proccess them before we can extract the desired 100 routes. The outbound 
route filtering feature allows the downstream router to control what the upstream 
neighbor is advertising to it. it is defined in RFC 5291 (outbound route 
filtering capacity for BGP-4). The downstream router signals the upstream 
provider with what view they want. They do this by advertising a prefix-list 
upstream and the prefix-list is used in the reverse direction.
</p>
<p>
On downstream router, configure prefix list and use send keyword. On upstream 
router, configure receive.
</p>
<p>
Outbound route filters are excellent for inbound filtering. ORFs are used by a 
BGP router to send a list of prefixes to a BGP peer that it will not filter so 
that the BGP peer does not send BGP Update messages (filters) containing 
prefixes that are not in the list. 
ORF seeks to answer the question: "Why send me prefixes I am going to filter 
anyway??". 

ORF is configured on both BGP routers using 
the BGP command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; capability orf 
prefix-list [both | receive | send]</b></code>. Verification can be done 
using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show ip bgp neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; received 
prefix-filter</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
On the device that does not want certain prefixes sent to it:
<div><code style="font-size:120%"><b>
#neighbor 10.0.0.9 capability orf prefix-list send<br>
#neighbor 10.0.0.9 prefix-list MYLIST in
</b></code></div>
</p>

<p>
After configuring ORF, clear the process using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>clear ip bgp 
* in prefix-filter</b></code>. Also show advertised routes on upstream router 
towards the downstream router.
</p>

<p>
ORF has the following features:
<ul>
  <li>ORF supports IPv4 and IPv6 unicast routes</li>
  <li>It does not support IP multicast routes.</li>
  <li>ORF can be used only with IP prefix-lists</li>
  <li>ORF has to be configured separately for every address family. It cannot be 
  configured under the global BGP process.</li>
  <li>ORF is supported only over eBGP sessions.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>AS Path Access Control Lists</h3>
<p>
There may be times when conditionally matching network prefixes may be too complicated,
and identifying all routes from a specific organization is preferred. In such a 
scenario, AS_Path access control lists can be used. AS_Path filtering is accomplished using an
AS Path Access Control List, which uses regular expressions for matching.
</p>
<p>
The following table shows regular expression characters that can be used in the
AS Path ACLs:

</p>
<p>
Filtering of prefixes from a BGP neighbor by using the AS_Path requires the 
definition of an AS_Path ACL. Processing is performed in a sequential top-down 
order and the first qualifying match processes against the appropriate permit or deny
action. An implicit deny exists at the end of the AS_Path ACL. IOS supports up 
to 500 AS Path ACLs. This is useful for the enterprise that has more than one 
service provider and does not want to provide transit capability.
</p>
<p>
In the following configuration of AS Path ACLs, we will restrict the advertisement
of prefixes to only locally generated prefixes i.e. to minimise the possibility 
of the autonomous system becoming a transit AS. The routes advertised by 
BGP devices R1 and R3 to eBGP peer R9 are displayed below:

<h3>Route-map</h3>
<p>
Route-maps can be used to filter prefixes by referencing access control lists or 
prefix lists. Route-maps can also be used to manipulate prefix path attributes 
of routes matched by the referenced access control lists or prefix-lists. A 
different route map can be used for each direction.
The following configuration causes the BGP device R6 to not advertise prefixes 
10.1.0.0 /17 and any subnets to its BGP peer 10.67.1.2. Prior to configuration 
of the route-map, BGP device as advertising the following prefixes to its peer 10.67.1.2:

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Create a prefix list or access control list to identify prefixes to be filtered.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">

R6(config)#<b>ip prefix-list PL_10.1.0.0/17 seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32</b><br>
</code></div>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Reference the prefix list or access control list with the route-map. In this case, we reference the 
 prefix list created in step 1.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">

The list of advertised routes to the BGP peer 10.67.1.2 confirms that the prefixes 10.1.0.0/17 - 32 have been filtered 
by the route-map.

Total number of prefixes 55
</code></div>

<h2>Next Hop Tracking</h2>
<p>
Next hop tracking involves the IGP sharing next hop information and their viability 
so that when there is a problem, the IGP informs BGP. Next hop tracking is enabled 
in IOS by default. It can be enabled using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp nexthop trigger enable<br>
bgp nexthop trigger delay 5</b></code>. The delay ensures that BGP does not react 
to a flapping route.
</p>

<h2>Fast External Fallover</h2>
<p>
BGP fast external fallover is critical for failovers for eBGP peers. It allows 
BGP to instantly detect failures of eBGP peers such as link failure between eBGP 
peers. It is not applicable to iBGP peers. It is enabled by default. If disabled, 
BGP fast external fallover can be enabled in the BGP configuration using the command
 <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp fast-external-fallover</b></code> or on an interface to enable BGP 
 fast external failover for the specific interface using the command 
 <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ip bgp fast-external-fallover</b></code>.  
</p>

<h2>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)</h2>
<p>
 Used to ensure the link is truly bidirectional. It operates in async mode or 
 demand mode. Bi-directional link failure occurs particularly in fibre optics if 
 a forward link functionals and the return link does not function. In Async mode, 
 hello packets flow between the two devices continuously. The echo feature makes 
 sure the CPU is nto involved in the BFD process.
</p>
<p>
After globally enabling BFD using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bfd interval &lt;milliseconds&gt; 
min_rx &lt;milliseconds&gt; multiplier value</b></code>; BFD can be enabled in BGP 
using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip-address&gt; fall-over bfd</b></code>
</p>

<h2>Prefix Independent Convergence</h2>
<p>
PIC ensures that alternate paths are at the ready if the primary path fails. It 
is similar in concept to feasible successors of EIGRP. It can be configured using 
the following commands:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp additional-paths install</b></code>: applies this behaviour 
  on the BGP database.</li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>no bgp recursion host</b></code>: speeds things by stopping the 
  scanning behaviour of the forwarding information base to get the info of the next hop. </li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp additional-paths [send|receive]</b></code>: BGP devices are 
  configured to send or receive these additional paths or both.</li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp additional-paths select ...</b></code>: Dictate which paths are 
  in the set that can be selected as the backup paths.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The backup paths are labelled with 'b' in the Loc-RIB. show ip bgp 
</p>

<h2>Graceful Restart</h2>
<p>
Graceful restart feature is agreed upon by routers during peering. Graceful restart 
allows a BGP device to continue to forward traffic to a BGP peer whose BGP process
is restarting. Two types of graceful restart exist: 
<ul>
  <li>Graceful-restart capable: has all features of graceful restart features.</li>
  <li>Graceful-restart aware: these devices do not do full graceful restart features 
  but are aware that neigbors are capable.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Can be configured per neighbor, global or in  aserssion template. The restart time 
is the time that the BGP peer is expected to complete the restart otherwise the 
peering will fail. By default, the graceful restart restart time is 120 sceonds. 
and a stalepath time is 360 (how long stalepaths are maintained until restart is 
complete). To confiigure graceful restart, under the BGP configuration issue the
 command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp graceful-restart</b></code>. The IOS will prompt to reset 
 peering for the configuration to take effect.
</p>

<h2 id="MAXIMUM_PREFIX">Maximum Prefix</h2>
<p>
By default, a full view is allowed from all peers. A full view generally should 
not come from downstream customers. Simple solution is to filter based on the 
number of prefixes i.e. <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor maximum-prefix</b></code>. The result 
can be log or shutdown peer.
</p>

<p>
The BGP maximum prefix feature restricts the number of routes that are received 
from a BGP peer. This feature ensures that the BGP table does not overwhelm the 
router by exceeding its memory or processing capability. Maximum prefix feature 
works with both eBGP and iBGP peers; though in production, it is typically 
configured for eBGP peers.

Routers can place prefix restrictions on a BGP neighbor by using the BGP address family configuration command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor ip-address maximum-prefix &lt;prefix-count&gt; [warning-percentage] [restart &lt;minutes&gt;] [warning-only]</b></code>.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
R1(config-router-af)#<b>neighbor 2.2.2.2 maximum-prefixes 45 75 warning-only</b>
</code></div>

<p>
The above configuration sets the maximum number of prefixes from BGP neighbor with BGP ID 2.2.2.2 at 45 with warning 
messages issued when the number of received prefixes from the BGP peer is at 75% the maximum prefix configured. 
Additionally, warning messages are issued after the number of received prefixes exceeds the configured maximum.
</p>
<p>
A warning is not generated before the prefix limit is reached. By adding a warning percentage, 
you can have a warning message sent when the percentage is exceeded. The maximum prefix 
behavior of closing the BGP session can be changed by using the optional keyword warning-only so that a warning 
message is generated instead. When the threshold has been reached, additional prefixes are discarded.

</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code style="font-size:120%">
*Dec 31 18:41:02.758: %BGP-4-MAXPFX: Number of prefixes received from 2.2.2.2 (afi 0) reaches 42, max 45 <br>
*Dec 31 18:57:34.138: %BGP-3-MAXPFXEXCEED: Number of prefixes received from 2.2.2.2 (afi 0): 46 exceeds limit 45
</code></div>
<p>
If the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>warning-only</b></code> keyword is not added when configuring the maximum-prefix, 
when a peer advertises more routes than the maximum prefix count:
<ol>
  <li>the peer moves the neighbor to the idle state in the finite-state machine (FSM),</li> 
  <li>closes the BGP session, </li>
  <li>and sends out the appropriate syslog message.</li>
  <li>The BGP session is not automatically reestablished by default.</li>
  <li>If you want to restart the BGP session after a certain amount of time, you can use the optional 
  keyword <code style="font-size:120%"><b>restart &lt;minutes&gt;</b></code>.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
<p>
Configuration of the maximum prefix takes effect immediately and does not require the reset of the BGP neighborship.
</p>

<h2>Tuning CPU and Memory</h2>
<p>
CPU usage can be viewed using the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show processes cpu sorted</b></code>.
In production environments, CPU consumption may rise to over 60%. Processes can 
be filtered for BGP as follows: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show process | include utilization | Runtime|BGP</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
To optimize BGP for efficiency with CPU utilization:
<ul>
  <li>Implement update groups; these are implemented by default on Cisco devices.
  update groups are more efficient than peer groups in CPU efficiency.</li>
  <li>Number of routes.</li>
  <li>Increase efficiency of TCP.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Tuning Memory</h3>
<p>
To view memory usage by BGP, show ip bgp summary, show ip route summary. show 
processes memory sorted | i PID|BGP.
To tune memory consumption:
<ul>
  <li>Aggregation</li>
  <li>Filtering</li>
  <li>neighbor reduction</li>
  <li>Route reflection</li>
  <li>Attribute reduction such as controlled use of communities.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Transport Optmization</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>TCP optimization thru MSS and window size.</li>
  <li>BGP update generation is automatically implemented using update groups.</li>
  <li>Optmization of TCP ACK: ACks can be buffered</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="DEFAULT_ROUTE">Default Route Propagation</h2>
<p>
A default route can be shared by an ISP to an enterprise AS.

A default route can be propagated to a BGP peer using the <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>default-originate</b></code>
keyword of the BGP <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>neighbor</b></code> command. An optional route-map 
can be added to the command. This route-map can be used to configure the conditions
that must exist before the default route can be propagated to the neighbor.
</p>
<p>
If a local static default route has been configured, it will be inserted into 
the BGP table in preference to the BGP propagated default route because a static 
route has a lower administrative distance (of one) than the BGP AD.
</p>

<h2>Route Flap Dampening</h2>
<p>
Route flapping occurs when a route is advertised and then withdrawn repeatedly 
over a short period of time. The advertised route may alternatively have 
different BGP next hops. Each time a route flap occurs, a BGP Update message 
must be sent to advertise the new route and/or withdraw previously advertised 
routes. Processing these BGP Update messages increases the router's CPU load.
eBGP neighbors going down/up is not considered a flap.

Route dampening aims to reduce the scope of route flap propagation. Prefixes with 
a history of flapping have the letter 'h' in the output of the Loc-RIB table.
</p>

<p>
Route flap dampening operation involves the following:
<ul>
   <li>Add a penalty for each flap.</li>
   <li>Exponentially decay penalty; half life determines the decay rate.</li>
   <li>Penalty above the suppress-limit; do not advertise the route to BGP peers.</li>
   <li>Penalty decayed below reuse-limite; re-advertise route to BGP peers.</li>
</ul>

Route flap dampening is only applied to inbound announcements from eBGP peers; 
alternate paths are still usable.

When a route flap occurs for a prefix:
<ul>
  <li>If a BGP withdrawal message is received, penalty on the increased by 1000 
  by default and the prefix is marked as having flap history</li>
  <li>If a BGP Update message is received, if the penalty is greater than 
  suppress-limit, the prefix is not announced to any BGP peers and is marked 
  as suppressed.</li>
  <li>If the prefix carries on flapping after being suppressed, penalty is 
  incremented and decayed as normal.</li>
  <li>Once prefix is stable, it will be suppressed according to the decay rate given 
  by the half life time.</li>
  <li>Penalty value is decayed every 5 seconds. Decay rate is same whether 
  prefix is or is not in the BGP table.</li>
  <li>Once penalty reaches reuse-limit, prefix is reannounced.</li>
  <li>Once penalty is less than half reuse-limit, penalty is reset to zero.</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>If the router receives an update about a route with a penalty, the half-life 
  timer starts. The default half-life value is 15 minutes. When the half-life is 
  reached, the penalty is reduced by 50%.</li>
  <li>If a route exceeds the suppress limit, the route is dampened. 
  The default suppress-limit value is 2000. Once a route 
  is dampened, it will not be installed into the routing table and won't be 
  advertised to BGP neighbors.</li>
  <li>To install or advertise a route, the penalty has to be lower than a reuse 
  limit. The default reuse limit is 750.</li>
  <li>If the penalty is below 50% of the reuse limit, the penalty is removed 
  completely. </li>
</ul>
The maximum suppress time, by default is 60 minutes, ensures that a route is 
not dampened indefinitely based on the route's flapping behavior. The recommended 
suppress threshold is 6,000 and max suppress threshold is 50,000.
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<h4>Fixed Dampening</h4>
<p>
BGP flap dampening can be configured using the following command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
bgp dampening &lt;half-life&gt; &lt;reuse&gt; &lt;suppress&gt; &lt;max-suppress&gt;
</b></code>
</p>
<h4>Selective and variable dampening</h4>
<p>
Selective dampening can be based on AS-PATH, Communities and Prefixes.
</p>
<p>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>
bgp dampening [route-map &lt;name&gt;] <br>
  route-map &lt;name&gt; permit 10 <br>
  match ip address prefix-list FLAP-LIST
  set dampening &lt;half-life&gt; &lt;reuse-value&gt; &lt;suppress-penalty&gt; 
   &lt;maximum suppress time&gt;
</b></code>
</p>
<p>
Examples (Wrong) <br>
bgp dampening 30 750 3000 60<br>
reuse-limit of 750 means maximum possible
penalty is 3000 - no prefixes suppressed as
penalty cannot exceed suppress-limit <br>
 Examples - (Correct) <br>
bgp dampening 30 2000 3000 60 <br>
reuse-limit of 2000 means maximum possible
penalty is 8000 - suppress limit is easily reached
</p>
<p>
Examples -(Wrong)<br>
bgp dampening 15 500 2500 30 <br>
reuse-limit of 500 means maximum possible
penalty is 2000 - no prefixes suppressed as
penalty cannot exceed suppress-limit <br>
 Examples - (Correct) <br>
bgp dampening 15 750 3000 45 <br>
reuse-limit of 750 means maximum possible
penalty is 6000 - suppress limit is easily reached
</p>

<H4>Examples</H4>
<p>
Example configurations using IOS defaults: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp dampening 15 750 2000 60</b></code>
<ul>
  <li>half-life of 15 minutes</li>
  <li>reuse-limiit of 750 and suppress time of 60 minutes means maximum possible 
  penalty of 12000</li>
  <li>once prefix stops flapping, penalty is decayed from a maximum possible 
  value of 12000 to 750 - this will take 60 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once penalty reaches 375, it is reset to zero.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Care is required when setting the parameters:
<ul>
  <li>Penalty must be less than reuse-limit at the maximum suppress time.</li>
  <li>Maximum suppress time and half life must allow penalty to be larger than 
  suppress limit.</li>
  <li>Devay rate pre-calculated when flap dampening configured. Numbers must 
  be feasible, IOS does not check.</li>
  <li>Always ensure that suppress-limit is less than max-penalty otherwise there 
  will be no route dampening.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>
Some verification commands include the following:
<ul>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b> show bgp ipv4 unicast flap-statistics</b></code></li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b> show bgp ipv4 unicast dampened-paths</b></code></li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b> clear bgp ipv4 unicast flap-statistics</b></code></li>
  <li><code style="font-size:120%"><b> clear bgp ipv4 unicast dampening</b></code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
BGP route flap dampening is thought to affect the stability of BGP tables.
</p>

<p>
Route flap dampening was introduced as a method to prevent the installation of 
flapping routes into the BGP table and lower the CPU load.   
The routers today have greater processing capacity to handle many BGP updates. As 
a result, BGP route flap dampening is not commonly used today.
</p>

<h2>Peering Using Loopback Addresses</h2>
<p>
BGP sessions are sourced by the primary IP address of the outbound interface toward the BGP peer by default. BGP 
uses an explicit configuration of IP address and if the IP addresses do not match, the relationship will not form or 
be maintained. If a link failure occurs on the outbound interface, then the session is dropped. To maintain the session 
despite the failure of the outbound links, configure an IGP on the router's transit links, advertise the loopback 
interfaces into the IGP and then configure the BGP neighbors to establish a session to the remote router's loopback address.
The loopback interface is virtual and always stays up. In the event of link failure, the session stays up and the IGP finds
another path to the loopback address. In essence, turning a single hop iBGP session into a multi-hop iBGP session.
</p>
<p>
If the BGP packet source does not match an entry in the neighbor table, the BGP packet cannot be associated to a neighbor 
and it is discarded. The source IP address of the BGP packets still reflects the IP address of the outbound interface.
The source of BGP packets needs to be set with each neighbor with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_addr&gt; update-source&lt; interface_id &gt; </b></code>
Links with loopback interfaces is recommended best practice. Verification of neighborship:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors 192.168.3.3</b></code>
</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Neighbor Options</h2>
<h3><code style="font-size:120%;">log-neighbor-changes</code></h3>
<p>
The <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>bgp log-neighbor-changes</b></code> command helps with logging the 
state of the BGP peering with a neighbor. On most Cisco IOS versions, this 
command is enabled by default.
</p>

<h1>BGP Synchronization</h1>
<p>
BGP configuration in more recent IOS versions includes an automatic inclusion of 
 of the command <code style="font-size:120%;"><b>no bgp synchronization</b></code>. BGP synchronization 
 was an attempt to eliminate traffic blackholes in an iBGP multihop topology where 
 intermediate routers are not running BGP. The essence of BGP synchronization was 
 that prefixes would only be advertised to iBGP peers only if they are available 
 in the IGP as well. This would ensure that any intermediate non-BGP routers would 
 be able to forward the traffic to/from prefixes that are advertised in BGP.
</p>
TODO: include topology of multihop iBGP.
<p>
BGP synchronization is not used because redistributing the large number of prefixes 
in the BGP table may overwhelm the IGP. Additionally, BGP synchronization is not 
used today because of the use of BGP scalability techniques such as full mesh, 
route reflection, and BGP confederations.

</p>

<h1>Troubleshooting BGP</h1>
<h2>Troubleshooting BGP Neighborship Failure</h2>
<p>
The following are some of the reasons a BGP neighbor relationship might not form:
<ul>
  <li><b>Interface is down: </b> The interface through-which the connection to the remote peer is made must be physically 
  up and the line protocol must be up. Use the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show ip interface brief</b></code> to 
  verify the interface status.</li>
  <li><b>Layer 3 connectivity is broken:</b> 
  You need to be able to reach the source IP address of the remote BGP peer. 
  Use the <code style="font-size:120%"><b>ping</b></code> command to verify connectivity.</li>
  <li><b>Path to the neighbor is through the default route:</b> You must be able to reach the neighbor using a route other than 
  the default route. BGP considers the most specific route in the routing table and disregards reachability through the 
  default route.</li>
  <li><b>Neighbor does not have a route to the local router:</b>
  The two routers forming a BGP peering must have routes to each other. The state of Idle or Active will be displayed in 
  the State/Pfx column of the command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast summary</b></code>.</li>
  <li><b>Incorrect neighbor statement:</b> The IP address and autonomous system number in the peer configuration command
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; remote-as &lt;as_number&gt;</b></code> statement must be accurate.                            </li>
  <li><b>ACLs:</b> An access control list (ACL) or a firewall may be blocking TCP port 179. BGP uses TCP port 179 when 
  operating in the server role. If the ACL is blocking incoming packets to this port and not outbound packets to port 179, 
  then the local BGP device can be made to operate in client-mode.</li>
  <li><b>BGP packets sourced from the wrong IP address:</b> The source IP address of an inbound BGP packet
  must match the local neighbor statement. If packets are sourced from a loopback interface, ensure that the 
  command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_addresss&gt; update-source</b></code> is configured.</li>
  <li><b>The TTL (time-to-live) of the BGP packet expires:</b> The peer may be further away than is permitted. In the case
  of eBGP, increase the TTL if packets are sourced from a loopback interface. TTL can be verified using the command:
  <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors | include BGP neighbor|TTL</b></code></li>
  <li><b>Mismatched authentication:</b> The two routers must agree on the authentication parameters.                                                                                                                </li>
  <li><b>Misconfigured peer group:</b> Peer groups simplify repetitive BGP configurations; however, if not carefully
  implemented, they can prevent neighbor relationships from forming or routes from being learned.</li>
  <li><b>Timers:</b> Timers do not have to match; however, if the minimum holddown from neighbor option is set, it could prevent
  a neighbor adjacency.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting Missing Prefixes</h2>
<p>
Some common reasons BGP routes might be missing from either the BGP table or the routing table:
<ul>
   <li><b>Missing or bad network mask command:</b> An accurate network command 
   is needed to advertise routes.</li>
   <li><b>Next-hop router not reachable:</b> To use a BGP route, the next hop must be reachable.                                                                  </li>
   <li><b>BGP split-horizon rule:</b> A router that learns BGP routes through an iBGP peering does not share those routes with another iBGP peer.                 </li>
   <li><b>Better source of information:</b> If exactly the same network is learned from a more reliable source, it is used instead of the BGP-learned information.</li>
   <li><b>Route filtering:</b> A filter might be preventing a route from being shared with neighbors or learned from neighbors.                                   </li>
   <li><b>BGP Synchronization:</b> Prefixes may be missing because BGP 
   synchronization has been enabled. BGP synchronization may have to be disabled 
   to ensure prefixes are advertised.</li>
   <li><b>BGP Communities:</b> Ensure that you send communities with the neighbor.</li>
</ul>                                                                                                                                                       </li>
</p>



<h1>Multiprotocol BGP for IPv6</h1>
<p>
Originally, BGP was intended for routing IPv4 prefixes. RFC2858 added multi-protocol BGP(MP-BGP) capability by adding 
address family identifier (AFI) extensions. 

MP-BGP RFC 4760 defines the following new features:
<ul>
  <li>New address family identifier (AFI) model          </li>
  <li>New BGPv4 optional and nontransitive attributes:   </li>
  <li>Multiprotocol reachable NLRI                       </li>
  <li>Multiprotocol unreachable NLRI                     </li>
</ul>
The multiprotocol reachable NLRI attribute describes IPv6 route information, and the multiprotocol unreachable NLRI 
attribute withdraws the IPv6 route from service. The attributes are optional and nontransitive, so if an older router 
does not understand the attributes, the information can just be ignored.
During the open message negotiation, the BGP peer routers exchange capabilities. The MP-BGP extensions include an address
family identifier (AFI) that describes the supported protocols, along with SAFI attribute fields that describe whether the prefix applies to the
unicast or multicast routing table:
IPv4 unicast: AFI:1, SAFI:1
IPv6 unicast: AFI:2, SAFI:1


MP-BGP extensions include an AFI that describe the supported protocols along 
with subsequent address family identifier (SAFI) attribute fields that describe whether the prefix applies to the unicast
or multicast routing table:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Protocol</td>
<td>AF1</td>
<td>SAFI</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPv4</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Every address family maintains a separate database in configuration for each protocol in BGP. This means that a database
exists for each protocol IPv4 unicast and a different one for IPv4 multicast routing. This allows for the routing policy of 
one address family to be different from the routing policy of a different address family even though the router uses a 
different BGP session with the other router. BGP includes AFI and SAFI with every route advertisement to differentiate 
between AFI and SAFI databases locally.
</p>
<p>
All the same underlying IPv4 path vector routing protocol features and rules also apply to MP-BGP for IPv6. MP-BGP for IPv6
continues to use the same well-known TCP port 179 for session peering that BGP uses for IPv6.
</p>
<p>
BGP configuration rules that apply to IPv4 apply to IPv6, except that the IPv6 address family must be initialized, and the neighbor is activated. Routers with only IPv6 addressing must statically define the BGP RID to allow sessions to form.
The TCP session used by BGP is a Layer 4 protocol (TCP port 179), and it can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address to form a session adjacency and exchange routes.
Unique global unicast addressing is the recommended method for BGP peering to avoid operational complexity. BGP peering using the link-local address may introduce risk if the address is not manually assigned to an interface. 
A hardware failure or cable move changes the MAC address, resulting in a new link-local address. This causes the session to fail because the stateless address autoconfiguration generates a new IP address.

</p>
<p>
During the initial open message negotiation, the BGP peer routers exchange capabilities such as the AFI and SAFI that each 
router will support. All the same underlying IPv4 path vectorrouting protocol features and rules also apply to MP-BGP 
for IPv6.
</p>
<p>
The configuration of BGP session involves the following commands:
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Ensure that IPv6 unicast routing is enabled with the configuration command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>ipv6 unicast-routing</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Initialise the BGP process with the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>router bgp &lt;as_number&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3 (Optional if IPv4 address configured on any interface):</b> Define the 
BGP router ID statically with the command: 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp router-id &lt;id&gt;</b></code>
If no IP address is configured, the router will dynamically choose an ID of 
0.0.0.0 and a BGP session will not be able to establish.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> Define the BGP neighbors's remote ASN with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; remote-as &lt;as_number&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 5 (Optional):</b> Define the BGP sessions password with MD5 hash:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; password &lt;password&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 6 (Optional):</b> Modify the BGP session timers with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; timers &lt;keep-alive_time hold_time&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 7:</b> Initialize the address family with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>address-family afi safi</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 8:</b> Activate the address-family for that neighbor with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor &lt;ip_address&gt; activate</b></code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 9:</b> Advertise IPv6 prefixes that are in the Loc-RIB with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>network &lt;prefix/prefix-length&gt; [route-map &lt;rmap_name&gt;]</b></code>
It is recommended not to use the same route-map for IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.
</p>
<p>
BGP configuration can be made hierarchical when viewing configuration using the 
command <code style="font-size:120%"><b>bgp upgrade-cli</b></code>

</p>
<p>
The following commands are helpful for understanding the current status of the router:
</p>

<h1>MP-BGP IPv6 Route Summarization</h1>
<p>
The same process for summarizing or aggregating IPv4 routes occurs with IPv6 routes. The format is identical except that 
the configuration is placed under the IPv6 address family using the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>aggregate-address prefix/length [summary-only] [as-set]</b></code>
</p>
<h2>Multi-Protocol BGP for IPv6 over IPv4</h2>
<p>
BGP can exchange routes using either an IPv4 or IPv6 session. Establish a BGP session with IPv4 addressing and activate 
the IPv6 address family. The IPv4 address family is always initialised by default. To disable IPv4 default address family, 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>no bgp default ipv4-unicast</b></code>
</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Configure an IPv4 neighbor</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Disable the default IPv4 address family</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Activate IPv4 neighbor via IPv6 address family</p>
<p>
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv6 unicast summary</b></code> shows neighbors have an IPv4 address but exchange IPv6 prefixes as shown
by the command: <code style="font-size:120%"><b>show bgp ipv6 unicast</b></code>
</p>
<p>In the Loc-RIB table, the next-hop displays an IPv4 address preceeded by FFFF:. This means that the next-hop is 
unreachable because it is an IPv4 address. To correct this problem manually, set the next-hop in a route-map on the 
advertising router and assign the route-map to the neighbor in the out direction under the IPv6 address family. 
Implement a soft reset for the changes to be applied to the Loc-RIB.
</p>
<h1>VRF-Lite for BGP</h1>
<p>
VRFs provide a virtualization context or segmentation of the RIB. It separates the global routing table from another VRF.
BGP supports VRFs. Every address family maintains a separate database and configurations in BGP. This allows for a routing policy 
in one address family to be different from a routing policy in a different address family,
This logic arries over to an address family per VRG per 
protocol. BGP is used as the routing protocol to exhange 
multiple VRG routes with ampulous layer 3 VPN provder edge routers with other routers. Using VRF-lite 
follows the same syntax. it just does not require the configuration of the VPN-v4 address family or sessions to be established w
with other provider=edge routers. Enabling VRF support on BGP is accomplished by the following steps:
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Define the BGP route distinguisher for teh VRF under the BRF definition with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>rd &lt;route_distinguisher&gt;</b></code>. The RD is a path attribute used in ampulous layer 3 VPN that ensures 
uniqueness of a prefix. A VPN prefix is an RD+Prefix. There is only one ED associated to a prefix.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Initialize the BGP process with the command:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>router bgp  &lt;as_number&gt;</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Initialize the address family for the VRF with the command 
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>address-family &lt;afi safi&gt;</b> vrf &lt;vrf_name&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> Define the BGP neighbor's remote autonomous system number:
<code style="font-size:120%"><b>neighbor <b>ip_address</b> remote-as &lt;as_number&gt;</code>
</p>
