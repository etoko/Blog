<h1>Virtual Routing and Forwarding Instances (VRFs)</h1>
<p>
VRFs are used to create a virtual router inside IOS. 
Interfaces assigned to that VRF belong to that routing table. Interfaces not in 
a VRF are in the "global" or default VRF. Implementing VRFs results in separate 
control plane instances, separate data plane based on routing. Addressing overlap 
is possible in different VRFs.
</p>
<p>
Routing inside a VRF can be through VRF-aware static routes, VRF aware dynamic 
routing: RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, MP-BGP, policy routing.
</p>
<p>
Two commands to create VRFs:
<ul>
  <li><code><b>ip vrf &lt;name&gt;</b></code>: supports only IPv4</li>
  <li><code><b>vrf definition</b></code> supports IPv4 and IPv6.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Specify the "route distinguisher" <code><b>rd &lt;ASN:nn|IP-address:nn&gt;<b></code>.
</p>
<p>
To apply the VRF to the interface:
<ul>
  <li>ip vrf forwarding &lt;name&gt;</li>
  <li><code><b>vrf forwarding &lt;name&gt;</li>
</ul>
Take note that the configuration removes the IP address from an interface. It 
is therefore important to run the <code><b>show ip interface brief</b></code> 
command before applying a VRF to an interface.
</p>
<p>
This minimum configuration is called "VRF Lite" i.e., VRFs without any MPLS 
configuration. 
</p>
<h1>Verification</h1>
<p>
<code><b>show ip route vrf &gt;vrf&lt;, ping vrf &lt;vrf&gt;, traceroute vrf 
&lt;vrf&gt;</b></code>.
Other features that must become VRF aware include NAT, IPSec.
</p>
<h1>VRF-lite vs MPLS VPNs</h1>
<p>
In VRF lite, all devices in transit path must carry all routes in all VRF tables.
In MPLS VPNs only PE routers need customer routes. This is accomplished through:
<ul>
  <li>VPNv4 BGP hwere the RD+prefix makes VPN routes globally unique.</li>
  <li>MPLS VPN tag/label:
    <ul>
      <li>P routers only need to know how to reach BGP next-hop.</li>
      <li>Uses "BGP free core"  logic.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
