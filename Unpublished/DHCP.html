<h1>Understanding  DHCP: Configuring and Optimization</h1>
<p>
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client server IP protocol used 
 by clients in a TCP/IP network to receive IP configuration parameters such as IP address, 
 default gateway, DNS server addresses, domain name among others from the server. 
 Bootstrap Protocol (BootP) is the predecessor to DHCP.
 In most network designs, multiple DHCP clients are connected but usually one DHCP 
 server is present. However, it is possible to have many DHCP servers available
 in the network.
 DHCP supports three mechanisms for IP address allocation;
<ul>
    <li><b>Automatic Allocation:</b> DHCP assigns a permanent IP address to a client.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic Allocation:</b> DHCP assigns an IP address to a client for a limited 
    period of time from an address pool. This is useful when client devices are 
    temporarily connected to the network</li>
    <li><b>Manual/Static allocation:</b> network administrator assigns an IP address to a 
    client and DHCP is used simply to convey the assigned address to the client</li>
</ul>    
</p>
<p>
Modern networks rely heavily on DHCP for dynamic address allocation to client 
devices such as phones, computers, IOT devices. Usually servers and network 
equipment have static IP addresses configured.
</p>
 
 <h2>DHCP Process</h2>
 <p>
DHCP uses a four stage process for DHCP servers to allocate IP configuration 
parameters to DHCP clients. These stages are; DHCPDiscovery, DHCPOffer, DHCPRequest,
DHCPAck. These four stages are usually abbreviated as DORA. In the DHCP IP 
parameter allocation process to clients, servers usually send packets using 
broadcasts or unicasts while clients always send broadcasts addressed packets.
</p>
 
 <h3>DHCPDiscover (Discover)</h3>
 <p>
 When a client connects to a network by Ethernet cable or Wireless, it sends a 
 DHCPDiscovery message to the broadcast destination IP address 255.255.255.255 
 and MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF with a source IP address of 0.0.0.0. The 
 source MAC address is the MAC address of the interface of client connected to 
 that network. This request is confined to the local network segment/subnet and does not 
 leave the local network. 
 The DHCPDiscover message is sent in a unicast-addressed packet only when it is 
 forwarded by a DHCP relay. Here the DHCP relay forwards the Discover message received 
 from the client to the server that is located in another network/subnet. It is 
 only in this scenario that the Discovery message leaves the local subnet.
 </p>
<p>
The DHCP client sends DHCPDiscovery packets using the source UDP port 68 to 
destination UDP port 67 on which the DHCP server listens.
</p>
 <p>
 If clients are not in the same subnet as the server, the DHCPDISCOVER message 
will have a non-zero value for giaddr field. The giaddr field will have a zero value
if the client and server are in the same subnet. 
The server matches the DHCPDISCOVER message with a pool that has the subnet that 
contains the IP address in the giaddr field. For directly connected clients, the 
receiving interface helps.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a client has previously connected to that network and attempts to reconnect 
 to the network, in the payload of DHCPDiscovery packet, it will set the value 
 of the DHCP option 50 to its previously issued IP address. It requsets the server 
 to issue it with its previously used IP address. The server may re-issue the 
 requested for address if it is still available in the DHCP pool.
 </p> 
 
 <h3>DHCPOffer (Offer)</h3>
 <p>
 The DHCPOffer message is sent by the DHCP server to a client in response to a 
 Discovery message received from the client.
 The source MAC address is the server's MAC address. The destination MAC address
 is the client MAC address. In some instances it can be a broadcast MAC address. 
 The source IP address is the server's IP address. 
 The destination IP address depends on the DHCP configuration on the server. 
 In some configurations, the destination adddress is the broadcast address
 255.255.255.255. In some configurations, some DHCP servers set the destination 
 IP address to the IP address that they are offering the client.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is option 53 in the DHCP packet options.
 Included in the DHCP offer packet is the client MAC address. The DHCP server 
 includes its IP address in the offer packet using in DHCP option 54. The protocol 
 is UDP with a source port of 68 and destination port of 67. DHCP Option 3 is 
 the router/default gateway address, the DNS server (option 6) and domain name 
 (option 15).
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If a network has multiple DHCP servers, and these servers respond to the client 
 request with offers, usually, the client will consider the first offer that it  
 receives. If a DHCP server cannot satisfy a DHCP request from its own database, it can 
forward the request to one or more secondary servers.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Because clients send broadcasts, any DHCP servers listening can respond to the 
 client's Discovery message. The client usually accepts the first DHCPOffer it 
 receives. If the client does not respond to the DHCPOffer message within a given 
 amount of time the server can reclaim the IP addresses that it had reserved for the client.
 </p>
 <p>
 
If an offer contains invalid configuration parameters, a client can respond with
a decline message (broadcast). A server sends a NAK denial broadcast message 
indicating that parameters are not assigned if an error occurred during the parameter 
negotiation or the client was slow in responding to the offer. This may also 
be the case if the address was assigned to another client by the server.
 </p>
 
 <h3>DHCPRequest (Request)</h3>
 <p>
 The DHCPRequest message is sent by the client to the server. The client requests 
 for the server to send the IP parameters that were included in the DHCPOffer 
 message. The previously offered IP address is still not used by the client. 
 The source IP address of this packet is 0.0.0.0 and source MAC address is the 
 host's MAC address. The destination IP address is either the broadcast address 
 255255.255.255 or the server's IP address. The destination 
  MAC address is either the broadcast MAC address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or the 
  server's MAC address.
 </p>
 <h3>DHCPACK (ACK)</h3>
 <p>
 The DHCPACK message is sent by the server to the client in response to the DHCP
 Request packet received from that client. The server acknowledges the received 
 DHCPRequest message with this packet. The source IP address is the server's 
 IP address. The source MAC address is the server's MAC address. The destination 
 IP address is the offered IP address or broadcast and destination MAC address 
 is host's MAC or broadcast MAC address.
 </p>
 
 <h1>Configuration of DHCP Server</h1>
 
 <p>
 A Cisco router and some switches can be configured as DHCP servers. By default, 
 DHCP server and relay agent features are enabled. If disabled, they can be 
 re-enabled using the command; 
 </p>
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
DHCP_SERVER(config)#<b>service dhcp</b>
</code></div>
<h2>Step 1: Excluded Addresses</h2>
<p>
Before configuring the DHCP features, it is best to first configure addresses to
be excluded from being assigned to clients. These are usually addresses reserved 
for hosts to receive addresses through static configuration. To exclude a range 
addresses from being assigned to clients enter the command;
<code><b>
ip dhcp excluded-address <i>low_IP_address high_IP_address</i></b></code>
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
DHCP_SERVER(config)#<b>ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.20</b>
</code></div>
<p>
Note that a router providing DHCP services can never issue an IP address for 
one of its interfaces even if that address is not included in the range of the 
excluded addresses. It may still be important to include the IP address of the 
default gatway for that subnet in the excluded IP address range. This is 
particularly critical if the DHCP server is in another network because it may not 
carry out a check for the existence of that IP address on the network before 
issuing the IP address to the client as does many local DHCP servers.
 </p>
 <h2>Step 2: Creation of DHCP Pools</h2>
 <p>
 A DHCP Pool is a range of IP addresess that are available for issuing to DHCP 
 clients. When a client sends out a DHCPDiscover message, the server will allocate  
 an IP address from the pool (usually the lowest available address) and offer it 
 to the client. There are two types of DHCP Pool network pool and host pool: 
 <ol>
   <li> <b>Network pool:</b> is the type of DHCP pool configured to provide IP 
   parameters for more than one client that we want to treat equally. Configured 
   using the command <code><b>ip dhcp pool <i> pool-name</i></b> <br>network <i>network address</i></code>. </li>
   <li><b>Host pool:</b> used to assign DHCP parameters to one particular client 
   that is identified using parameters usually the MAC address. The command  
   <code><b>network</b></code> is replaced with the command <code><b>client-identifier 0100.1b78.56f4.4a<br>
 host 192.168.200.200 /24</b></code>. The hardware or MAC address is configured
 as the value of the client-identifier. This is particularly important for Linux clients whose 
 DHCP requests may exclude certain parameters.
   The media type is included as a prefix in the value for client-identifier.  
   The media type is a code that identifies the medium that the client 
   used to connect to the network i.e. wireless or cable. In the case of 
   Ethernet, the media type is 01. 
   </li>
 </ol>
 </p>
 
 <p>
 DHCP-issued IP addresses are issued for a limited period of time, known as 
 lease time. By default, in Cisco IOS, the lease time is 12 hours. It is possible 
 to permanently allocate an IP address to a client. However, this is rare.
 A DHCP pool usually has a limited number of addresses that are 
 issued to the clients so that the addreses get reused. The duration of the 
 lease period can be guided by;
 <ul>
   <li>Number of available addresses in the pool.</li>
   <li>Average duration that clients remain connected to the network.</li>
 </ul>
 Typically, a host will renew its address halfway into its lease time.
 </p>
 <p>
 On Microsoft Windows Server DHCP servers, the address pool is referred to as a scope.
 </p>

The following commands are available when configuring DHCP on a Cisco IOS device.

 <h2>Database Agents</h2>
 <p>
 Database Agents

A database agent is any host for example a (T)FTP server, RCP (Remote Copy 
Protocol) server that stores the DHCP bindings database. It could also be a 
storage media device or partition on the DHCP server.y
It is recommended by Cisco for a DHCP database agent to be configured. The purpose 
of the DHCP database agent is to store the recording od DHCP address conflicts. 
So that if the Cisco IOS device (router or switch) reboots, the conflict loggings 
cannot be lost. If these are lost, some addresses run the risk of being removed 
from the pool and yet are not assigned to a client. This leads to wastage of 
addresses.

To entirely disable a DHCP address conflict logging, run the command;
DHCP_SERVER(config)#no ip dhcp conflict logging
To export the DHCP bindings database to a database agent, enter the following command;
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
DHCP_SERVER(config)#<b>ip dhcp database <i>url</i></b>
</code></div>

 <h2>DHCP Server Pinging and Address before Offer</h2>
 <p>
 
DHCP Server Pinging an address before Offer to Client

Before a DHCP server offers an IP address to a client, the server first pings the 
IP address to confirm that no other host has that address. By default, the address 
is pinged twice before being issued. However, you can configure the number of times 
that a DHCP server pings an address before it offers the address using the command;

DHCP_SERVER(config)#ip dhcp ping packets 5

Here, the value five (5) has been entered indicating that the DHCP server should 
ping the IP address five times before offering the address in a DHCPOFFER message
to the client.

Setting the ping number to zero deactivates the ability of the DHCP server to 
ping an IP address before offering it in a DHCPOFFER message. Take note that 
this may compromise the ability of a DHCP server from detecting IP address 
conflicts using the ping method.

If a host exists on the network with an IP address that the DHCP server intends 
to offer to a client, the server will record an IP address conflict and how it 
determined the conflict. In this case the conflict will the determined by pinging.

 <h2>DHCP Relay</h2>
 <p>
 In some network designs, IP address management is centralised. In such designs, 
 the DHCP server may not be present in the local subnet.
 The default gateway of DHCP clients in that subnet will need to be configured 
 so that DHCP requests are forwarded to the remote server. The default gateway 
 device acts as a relay between the DHCP client and server. Messages exchanged 
 between the relay and server are sent in unicast. Relay agents are used to forward 
 DHCP messages between clients and servers when they are not in the same subnet.
</p>
<p>
Relay agent supports the use of unnumbered interfaces through adding a static 
host route.
To configure a local router as a DHCP relay, use the following command;
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
Router(config)#<b>interface gigabitEthernet0/0</b><br>
Router(config-if)#<b>ip helper-address 10.1.14.2</b>
</code></div>

The IP address entered here is the address of the dhcp server. The ip helper-address 
is entered under interface configuration mode of the interface connected to the 
subnet that contains the DHCP clients. This is the interface that will receive 
the DHCPDiscover messages from the clients.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Import Configuration Parameters</h2>
 <p>
To import DHCP options into a local DHCP server database from a remote/central 
DHCP server, use the following command;
</p>
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
DHCP_SERVER(config)#<b>ip dhcp pool DHCP_POOL</b><br>
DHCP_SERVER(dhcp-config)#<b>network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0</b><br>
DHCP_SERVER(dhcp-config)#<b>import all</b>
</code></div>

 
 <h2>DHCP Optimization</h2>
 <h3>Ping Timeout</h3>
 <p>
 The default timeout of these DHCP servers is 500ms (milliseconds). To change 
 this value, issue the following command in global configuration mode;
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
DHCP_SERVER(config)#<b>ip dhcp ping timeout 200</b>
</code></div>

Note that setting a higher value for ping timeout and number of packets increases 
the amount of time that a client takes to receive an IP address through DHCP.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 
In order to optimise DHCP operation, it may be advisable to carryout the following
configurations;
<ul>
  <li>In an Ethernet network (wired) with fewer than 254 hosts, the default 
  number of pings is OK. It may be possible to decrease the ping timeout value 
  if the DHCP server is in the same subnet as the host, or less than three hops away. 
  Timeout values of 70ms are OK for an entirely wired path from client to server 
  with no more than 5 hops.
    <li>In a wireless configuration, the timeout value can be decreased to 200ms.
    <li>In a large network with several hosts (more than 254) having static addresses,
    increase the number of pings to four.
    <li>Increasing the switch MAC address holdtime may also help improve DHCP 
    performance. This may eliminate the need for ARP when a client initially 
    connects to the network.
</ul>
 </p>
 
<h2>Monitoring and Maintaining a DHCP Server</h2> 

 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
Router#<b>clear ip dhcp binding <i>ip_address</i> </b><br>
Router#<b>clear ip dhcp conflict                  </b><br>
Router#<b>clear ip dhcp server statistics         </b>
</code></div>

<p>
To remove a route from the routing table added by a DHCP server or DHCP relay 
agent or clients using unnumbered interfaces;
</p>
 <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
Router#<b>clear ip route <i>vrf name</i> dhcp <i>ip_address</i></b>
 </code></div>

 <h2>DHCP Client Configuration</h2>
 <p>
 To configure the clients:
 <ul>
   <li>Enable DHCP: <code><b>service dhcp</b></code></li>
   <li>Configure interface: <code><b>ip address dhcp client-id <i>interface</i> 
   hostname <i>name</i></b></code>
 </ul>
 If the DHCP client is a Linux box, the BootP flag is set to 00 in the DHCP Discover
 packet. This requests the DHCP server to exchange any more DHCP packets in unicast. 
 the 
 </p>
 <p>
 To prompt a CISCO IOS DHCP client to request for a new IP address:
 <ul>
   <li>Shutdown the interface and turn it on.</li>
   <li><code><b>release dhcp <i>interface</i></b></code></li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 An IOS DHCP client sends a DHCPRelease message to the DHCP server if the DHCP 
server facing interface is configured from receiving the IP address through DHCP
to manually configured.
 </p>
 <p>
 The default route received by DHCP in IOS DHCP client is given an AD of 254 and 
 is considered a static route. To ignore the default route sent by DHCP, change 
 the AD of the default route sent by DHCP using the command:
 <code><b>ip dhcp-client default-router distance 255</b></code>
 </p>
 <h1>Verification</h1>
 <h2><code>show ip dhcp binding</code></h2>
 <p>
 Shows the MAC address of the client and the IP address that was assigned to that 
 client as well as the expiration of the lease. 
 </p>
 <p>
 In wireshark captures, the Bootp flag 01 or the DHCP discover message requests 
 the DHCP server to respond to the broadcast destination.
