<h1>Routing Loops</h1>
<h1>Route Tags</h1>
<p>
To create a route tag list, use the global configuration mode command: 
<code><b>route-tag list <i>list_name</i></b></code>
</p>
<div>
  <code>
    route-tag list TO_CAT2  seq 10 permit 0.0.0.2 0.0.0.0<br>
  </code>
</div>
<p>
A route-tag can be referenced inside of a route map using the keyword <code><b>match</b></code>.
</p>
<div>
  <code>
    route-map ADV_TO_R4 permit 10<br>
	  match tag list TO_CAT2
  </code>
</div>
<p>
To filter advertisements:
</p>
<div>
  <code>
    router eigrp 10
	distribute-list route-map ADV_TO_R4 out eth0/0 
  </code>
</div>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> that distribute-lists have an impact on high-availability and fail-over.
</p>
<h3>Distribute List</h3>
<p>
Allow the filtering of network prefixes on a neighbor-by-neighbor basis using standard or extended 
access control lists.
</p>
<h3>Prefix List</h3>
<p>
Allow the filtering of network prefixes on a neighbor-by-neighbor basis using a prefix list.
</p>
<h3>Filter-List</h3>
<p>
Used in OSPF and BGP. In OSPF filter lists can be used to filter prefixes between OSPF areas.
</p>
<h3>Preventing Loops with Tags</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h1>Split Horizon</h1>
<p>
Split horizon is a method of preventing routing loops in distance-vector 
routing protocols such as RIP and EIGRP by prohibiting a router from 
advertising a route back onto the interface from which it was learned.
Split horizon follows the principle that; Never advertise a route out 
of the interface through which you learned it.
</p>
<p>
Split horizon prevents the advertisement of reverse routes. EIGRP and BGP enable split horizon by default.
DMVPN is one of the technologies that will require the disabling of split horizon on the hub.
</p>
<p>
To disable split-horizon on an interface, use the interface configuration 
command: <code><b>no ip split-horizon {eigrp <ASN>}</b></code>
</p>
<p>
TODO:
<ol>
  <li>View split horizon status of an interface.</li>
  <li>Disable split horizon on interface</li>
  <li>Disable split horizon for EIGRP. Note: EIGRP resyncs after split horizon change.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h1>Route Poisoning</h1>
<p>
Advertises a prefix with an infinity metric; in RIP, this is metric of 16., OSPF sets the LSA age to 3600

</p>

<h1>Maximum Hops</h1>
<p>
The maximum hops in EIGRP can be modified using the EIGRP router configuration 
command: <code><b>metric maximum-hops <i>number</i></b></code> where 
<code><i>number</i></code> is the maximum number of hops beyond which a route 
will be considered unreachable.
The modification of the maximum-hops results in a new adjacency being created 
with existing neighbors.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Modification of the maximum-hops results in the deletion of 
all EIGRP sourced routes in the RIB.
</p>
<p>
The maximum-hops can be configured using the command: 
<code><b>show ip protocols</b></code>
</p>
<p>
 In EIGRP named mode, the maximum-hops can be configured under the topology base 
 address-family configuration mode.
</p>

<h1>Filtering</h1>
<h2>EIGRP</h2>
<p>
Configuration of a distribution-list results in a resynchronization. Modification 
of the referenced access lists also results in a resynchronization.
</p>
<p>
Access-lists additionally affect the high-availability when interfaces do down.
</p>
<h1>Offset Lists</h1>
<p>
When configuring offset-lists, configuring an non-existent ACL or configuring 
zero (0) results in all network prefixes being included in their offset-lists
metric modification.
