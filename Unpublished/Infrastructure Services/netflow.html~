<h1>Netflow: Overview and Introduction</h1>
<p>
Netflow is a Cisco application that collects statistics on network traffic.
it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a 
network administrator can determine things such as source and destination of traffic, 
class of service, and the causes of congestion. Most NetFlow devices support export  
versions 1, 5, and 9. Version 1 is used by default. the traffic in and out of a network 
device. Netflow provides insights into the network traffic patterns.
</p>
<p>
NetFlow provides insights into the state of network traffic and this information 
can be utilized in network and security monitoring, network planning, traffic 
analysis, and IP accounting.
</p>
<p>
Netflow provides the ability to view the network traffic grouped by protocol. With 
this feature, using netflow a baseline of network traffic can be performed before 
the introduction of a new network service or implementation of traffic shaping.
</p>
<p>
For Internet-facing routers that run NAT, it is recommended that Netflow be 
configured on the router interface connecting to the local network i.e. before 
NAT translations. If Netflow is configured on the Internet-facing interface, 
NAT will have been implemented and it becomes difficult to understand traffic 
flow patterns of local devices as their local/internal IP addresses will already 
have been translated by NAT.
</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:
<ul>
  <li><b>Flow exporter:</b> aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records 
  towards one or more flow collectors. This is usually the router.</li>
  <li><b>Flow collector:</b> responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing 
  of flow data received from a flow exporter.</li>
  <li><b>Analysis application:</b> analyzes received flow data in the contect of 
  intrusion detection or traffic profiling, for example.</li>
  <li><b>NetFlow cache(optional):</b> the record for each active flow is maintained 
  in the cache.
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
A network flow is a unidirectional stream of packets between a given source and 
destination. Netflow captures statistics on IP flows through a device. It is used 
on top of an existing switching path such a CEF. NetFlow uses the following fields
to identify a unique flow:
<ul>
  <li>Source IP address</li>
  <li>Source port number</li>
  <li>Destination IP address</li>
  <li>Destination port number</li>
  <li>Layer 3 protocol type</li>
  <li>Type of service</li>
  <li>Logical input interface</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Traffic monitored by Netflow can be classified into the following categories:
<ul>
  <li><b>Device:</b> flow count, traffic and volume</li>
  <li><b>Interface:</b> bandwidth utilization, traffic, packets, and volume.</li>
  <li><b>Application:</b> traffic with port and protocol details.</li>
  <li><b>Conversation:</b> source, destination, application, and traffic</li>
  <li><b>Quality of Server(QoS):</b> DSCP and traffic.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Version 5</h2>
<p>
Fixed format that cannot be added or extended. IPv4 support only. Added BGP support.
Export data from main cache only. No real concept of ingress and egress flows.
</p>
<h2>Version 9</h2>
<p>
A flexible and extensive format, which provides the versatility needed for support 
of new fields and record types. It provides support for new NetFlow-supported 
technologies such as multicast, Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS), BGP next hop.
NetFlow version 9 is template-based. Templates provide a means of extending the 
record format, a feature that should allow future 
</p>
<p>
Support IPv6.
Not backwards compatible with any previous version
Added additional information to flows and templated-based.
Exports data from main and aggregate cache
Support for MPLS.
</p>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
Netflow traffic is unidirectional i.e., can be ingress or egress traffic.
In interface configuration mode: 
<ul>
  <li><code><b>ip flow ingress</b></code>: enables netflow for outbound traffic on 
  an interface</li>
  <li><code><b>ip flow egress</b></code>: enables Netflow for inbound traffic on 
  an interface.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Local Retrieval</h1>
<p>
Local retrieval is also known as stand-aline mode where netflow records are stored 
in the local router memory. This information can be accessed using the CLI.

You can view Netflow information from either the collector or the CLI. You first 
must enable NetFlow locally:
<code><b>
ip flow-top-talkers<br>
top 10<br>
sort-by [packets | bytes]<br>
cache-timeout 30000 (value is in milliseconds)<br>
</b></code>
</p>
<p>
To view the flows, use the command <code><b>show ip flow top-talkers</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
Netflow is a heavy resource hungry feature. It is recommended not to enable 
netflow on a router that is experiencing heavy resource constraints.
</p>

<h1>Export (Configuration Only)</h1>
<p>
The Netflow record is traditionally exported by using UDP and collected by the 
Netflow collector. An IP address of a Netflow collector and a destination UDP port 
has to be configured on the flow exporter. A router(netflow exporter) will maintain 
a track of flow record which is already exported, hence if the Netflow packets are 
dropped in the event of packet corruption or network congestion. So that the 
modern Netfloww implementation uses the SCTP(stream control transmission protocol) 
to export the packets to offer protection against the loss of packets and also 
assures that the Netflow v9 template is received before exporting the related 
record. The Netflow export only uses the network backbone link, packet loss can 
be negligible. 
</p>
<p>
The netflow collector listens for Netflow records on UDP or SCTP. However, 
the port is not explicitly defined. The administrator can configure a UDP port 
of choice; the commonly configured port number is 9995, 9996 or 9999. It is 
important to note that when configuring a Netflow collector 
to collect netflow records from more than one netflow exporter, each netflow 
exporter should be configured to export flow records to a different port number.
Otherwise the netflow collector will aggregate the flow records. So it is 
recommended to configure one port for one netflow expoter.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><code><b>ip flow-export destination &lt;ip-address&gt; &lt;port&gt; [sctp|udp]</b></code>
  : specifies the IP address and destination port for exported Netflow records.</li>
  <li><code><b>ip flow-export version [5|9]</b></code>: specifies the format of 
  exported Netflow records.</li>
  <li><b>Specify the source IP address:</b> the source IP address can be configured 
  using the command <code><b>ip flow-export source &lt;interface&gt;</b></code>.
  This is particularly important in scenarios where, with multipathing, netflow 
  records may be different source IP addresses due to the different egress 
  interfaces that the netflow traffic may have used. This command ensures that the 
  source IP address is consistent.</li>
</p>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Flexible Netflow</h1>
<p>
Flexible NetFlow improves on original NetFlow by adding the capability to customize 
the traffic analysis parameters for your specific requirements. Flexible NetFlow 
facilitates the creation of more complex configurations for traffic analysis and 
data export through the use of templates which are reusable conifguration 
components.
</p>
<p>
When configuring flexible NetFlow, consider the following:
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the source interface is a loopback interface. This is because 
  this interface does not do down resulting in predictable source IP addresses
  in the NetFlow records.</li>
  <li>Set the active timeout to 1 minute using the command <code><b>ip flow-cache 
  timeout active</b></code>.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It supports the ability to configure different destinations(collectors) for 
different categories of traffic.
</p>
<p>
To configure flexible netflow:
<ol>
  <li><b>Define the Record:</b> using the command <code><b>flow record &lt;flow-name</b></code></li>
  <li><b>Match the traffic category:</b> using the command 
  <code><b>match [ipv4|ipv6|interface|flow|datalink|application|routing|transport]</b></code>. 
  The following command matches all traffic based on the type of service value(TOS) 
  <code><b>match ipv4 tos</b></code>.
  <p>
  <div>
  <code>
  flow record FLOW-RECORD-1<BR>
  description Netflow record format to send to NetFlow collector<br>
  match ipv4 ttl<br>
  match ipv4 tos<br>
  
  </code></div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Define what information should be collected:</b> using the command 
  <code><b>collect datalink mac [destination|source]</b></code>. The following 
  example collects the count of traffic in bytes: <code><b>collect counter bytes</b></code>.
  <p>
  Other examples include:
  collect interface output
  collect counter packets long
  collect counter bytes long
  collect timestamp absolute first
  collect timestamp absolute last
  
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Create Flow Export configuration</b>
  <p>
  <div><code>
  flow exporter NETFLOW-COLLECTOR-1<br>
  description  Export NetFlow to collector<br>
  destination 1.2.3.4<br>
  source g0/0<br>
  transport udp 9999<br>
  export-protocol ipfix<br>
  </div></code>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Configure a flow monitor:</b> the flow monitor ties the flow record to 
  the flow exporter.
  <p>
  <div>
  <code>
  flow monitor FLOW-MONITOR-1<br>
    record FLOW-MONITOR-1 (note: netflow-original is predefined flow record)<br>
    exporter NETFLOW-COLLECTOR-1<br>
    cache timeout active 60<br>
  </code></div>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The netflow monitor aggregates the flow exporter and flow record data.
</p>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Consider the unidirectional nature of netflow traffic. Verify using the following 
commands:
<ul>
  <li><code><b>ip flow ingress</b></code></li>
  <li><code><b>ip flow outbound</b></code></li>
  <li><code><b>show ip flow interface</b></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Consider the appropriate interface. Verify configured interfaces using <code><b>show ip flow 
interface</b></code>.
</li>
<li>
Consider exporting to a collector: verify configured settings using <code><b>
show ip flow export</b></code>. 
</li>
<li>Consider the source of netflow export packets; verify with the commands:
<ul>
  <li><code><b>ip flow-export source &lt;interface</b></code></li>
  <li><code><b>show ip flow export</b></code></li> 
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider versions 5 and 9, with version 9 being the more popular choice. Verify 
using the command <code><b>ip flow-export version[5|9]</b></code> and 
<code><b>show ip flow-export</b></code>.
</ul>
