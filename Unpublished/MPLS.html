<h1>MPLS</h1>
<p>
Is a service provider technology but is also used by enterprises. It is also 
used to replace dedicated serial lines to interconnect separate offices.
</p>
<p>
MPLS is globally enabled. MPLS is supported on almost all Cisco routers.
By default, MPLS traffic follows the same path as regular IP traffic would.
By default, all IGP routes will have a label assigned.
</p>
<p>
MPLS consists of: 
<ul>
<li><b>MPLS data plane:</b> how MPLS traffic is forwarded in, out and throughout the MPLS 
network</li>
<li><b>Control plane:</b> deals with how the labels are assigned and exchanged in the MPLS 
network.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>MPLS Data Plane</h2>
<h3>Terms used in MPLS</h3>
<p>
Assumption is that the MPLS control-plane is fully functional.
<ul>
  <li><b>Label Switching Routers (LSRs):</b> all participating routers in MPLS 
  network.</li>
  <li><b>Edge LSR:</b> The LSRs at the edge of the network where traffic enters 
  and exits the MPLS network are referred to as edge routers.</li> 
<li><b>Ingress Edge LSR:</b> The edge LSR where IP packets enter the MPLS network.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When an incoming IP packet enters the ingress LSR, a lookup is done in the 
Label Forwarding Information Base(LFIB). The LFIB contains information on how 
the label gets switched.
