<h1>Path Control using Policy Based Routing (PBR)</h1>
<p>
By default, routers make forwarding decisions based on the destination IP address 
of the packet. This is known as destination-based routing where the 
routing table is checked to determine next-hop IP address and the exit interface 
through which packets are forwarded towards the destination. 
In majority of network designs, destination-based routing meets designed network
traffic flow. However, in some cases, some network traffic may require special 
treatment for instance traffic to remote corporate resources may be preferred to be routed 
through a specific ISP over another.
</p
<p>
Policy-Based Routing(PBR) provides the capability to override the default 
destination-based routing behaviour of routing devices. 
PBR is implemented using a route-map to identify which unicast packets are to be 
policy-routed and how to route the traffic. A unicast packet arriving on a 
PBR-configured interface will be subject to PBR except when its destination IP 
address is the same as the IP address of the router's interface. Because PBR uses 
a route map, it provides solutions in cases where legal, contractual, or political 
constraints dictate that traffic is routed through specific paths.<br>
<b>Note:</b> PBR is only applicable to unicast packets; it is not applicable to 
multicast packets.
</p>

<p>
PBR makes forwarding decisions independent of the routing table. These forwarding 
decisions may be based upon any one or combination of the following:
<ul>
 <li>IP address i.e. destination IP address, source IP address or combination of 
 the two.</li>
 <li>Protocol type i.e. IP protocols such as ICMP, TCP, UDP or TCP and UDP 
 applications such as HTTP, FTP, SSH etc.</li>
 <li>Packet size: a range can be configured and packets whose sizes fall within 
 this range can be policy routed.</li>
 <li>Incoming interface</li>
 <li>Manual assignment of different network paths to the same destination, based 
     on tolerance for latency, link speed etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Some of the drawbacks of conditional routing include the following:
<ul>
<li>Administrative burden in scalability</li>
<li>Lack of network intelligence</li>
<li>Troubleshooting complexity</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>PBR Fast Switching</h2>
<p>
In earlier IOS versions, PBR was implemented at the control-plane rather than the
data-plane. This made it highly CPU-intensive PBR was not able to utilize CEF and RSVP.
It was therefore process-switched. In later IOS versions, PBR is fast-switched 
and is operationally compatible with CEF, distributed CEF. 
With process-switching, many platforms supported switching rates of 1000 to 10,000
packets per second. This may not be fast enough for some applications. Fast-switched 
policy routing supports all route-map <code><b>match</b></code> commands and most 
 <code><b>set</b></code> commands except for the following:
<ul>
  <li><code><b>set ip default</b></code></li>
  <li><code><b>set interface</b></code></li>
</ul>
Fast-switched PBR is enabled by default. However, if disabled, to configure 
fast-switched policy routing, use the interface configuration command 
<code><b>ip route-cache policy</b></code>
</p>

<h2>PBR Application Scenarios</h2>
<p>
Possible applications of PBR include:
<ul>
  <li>Routing based on interactive rather than batch traffic.</li>
  <li>Routing of selected traffic based on dedicated links.</li>
  <li>Protocol-sensitive routing.</li>
  <li>Source-sensitive routing.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Policy Routing Variations</h2>
<p>
PBR can be configured to modify the next-hop for two types of traffic:
<ol>
  <li><b>Incoming Traffic:</b>
    PBR is configured on the ingress interface of the traffic using the interface
    mode command: <code><b> ip policy route-map &lt;route-map-name&gt;</b></code>
    Application of PBR on an interface does not affect locally generated traffic.
  </li>
    
  <li><b>Locally-originated traffic</b>: 
   Locally-generated traffic includes consists of mainly routing protocol packets. 
   Additionally, it may include pings, traceroutes from the local router.
   For locally-generated traffic, PBR is configured
      in global configuration mode using the command:
      <code><b>ip local policy route-map &lt;route-map-name&gt;</b></code>.
      Some IOS versions do not have control plane checks.
   </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Configuration of Policy-Based Routing (PBR)</h1>
<p>
PBR is configured through a series of steps:
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Define Traffic an Access Control List or Prefix-List.</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Standard Access Control List:</b> To match against only the packet source IP 
  address.</li>
  <li><b>Extended Access Control List:</b> To match against any IP protocols such 
  as TCP, UDP, ICMP, source IP address, destination IP address or both, 
  TCP or UDP applications by port numbers or name.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When configuring an ACL or prefix-list to identify traffic to be policy routed:
<ul>
  <li>A <code><b>permit</b></code> statement in the access control list or 
  prefix-list means to policy route the identified traffic.</li>
  <li>A <code><b>deny</b></code> statement means to use destination-based 
  forwarding where the routing table is consulted for the next-hop to the 
  destination network. It does not mean that the traffic is to be blocked.</li>
</ul>
In the following configuration, ICMP traffic and UDP traffic from host 192.168.1.2 
to host 172.31.0.1 has been identified for policy routing using an extended ACL. 
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>                                                                   
R1(config)#<b>ip access-list extended ACL_172.31.0.0/24</b>                    <br>

</code></div>




<h2>Step 2: Configure a Route-map</h2> 
<p>

</p>

 <h3>Identification of Traffic</h3>
 <p>
 Traffic is identified in a route map using the <code><b>match</b></code> 
 statement and referencing the ACL or prefix-list configured in Step 1.
Depending on the hardware platform or IOS version, many characteristics of 
the traffic can be matched.
</p>
<h4>Match condition considerations</h4>
<p>
What you can match on usually will depend on specifically how you are 
  classifying the traffic; packets can be matched by:
  <ul>
    <li><b>IP address:</b> 
    an ACL or prefix list can be used to match traffic by IP address.
    <ul>
      <li>To match traffic using an ACL, use the command: <code><b>match 
  ip address &lt;acl_name or number&gt; </b></code>. Match all or match any based 
  on how the match statements are written in the clause. <code><b> match ip address 
  10, 20 - 30, MY_ACL,</b></code> match any.
  
  <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R1(config)#<b>route-map RM_PBR_172.31.0.1 permit 10</b><br>
R1(config-route-map)#<b>match ip address ACL_172.31.0.0/24</b><br>
</code></div>
  
  </li>
  <li>To match traffic using a prefix-list, use the command:
  <code><b>match ip prefix-list &lt;prefix-list-name&gt; </b></code>.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Packet length(in bytes)</li>
    <li>Source routing protocol</li>
    <li>Route-tag</li>
    <li>Route metric</li>
   </ul> 
    
</p>
<p>
Matching against a prefix-list is commonly in BGP.	
</p>

 <h3>Defining an Action to Take on Identified Traffic</h3>
<p>
 After the matching, the action to be taken to the matched traffic is configured 
using the route-map <code><b>set</b></code> command.
The conditions that can be modified by the <code><b>set</b></code> command is 
highly dependent on the platform and the IOS version; for PBR the action is 
usually the <code><b>next-hop</b></code> keyword:
<ul>
  <li><code><b>set next-hop &lt;ip_address&gt;</b></code>: the next hop is 
  unconditionally used; the configured next-hop will be used to forward traffic 
  and the routing table will not be consulted.
  <div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R1(config-route-map)#<b>set ip next-hop 10.0.13.2</b>
</code></div>
  </li>
  <li><code><b>set default next-hop &lt;ip_address&gt;</b></code>: IP routing 
  table is first consulted for the next hop before the configured next hop is 
  considered. If the specific destination network does not exist in the routing 
  table, then the PBR defined next hop is considered. The matching of routes in 
  the RIB holds true except the default route. The routing table default route 
  is not considered.
  This can be considered as some sort of default route for matched traffic. The 
  next hop has to be directly connected to the local router. The recursive 
  keyword enables configuration of a next-hop that is not directly connected.
  </li>
  <li><code><b>set interface &lt;exit-interface&gt;</b></code>: The egress interface 
  for the matched packets is defined. PBR does not verify if the configured 
  egress interface is up or down. When configuring the exit interface, a warning 
  message is issued recommending that a P2P interface be configured such as a
  serial interface. It is recommended that the egress interface be a serial 
  interface. If an interface in a broadcast environment such as FastEthernet or 
  GigabitEthernet is used, an ARP request is sent for each and every packet. If 
  the configured egress interface is down, the router will route traffic using the RIB.</li>
  <li><code><b>set default interface &lt;exit-interface&gt;</b></code>: The RIB 
  is consulted first to determine the egress-interface. If RIB does not have the 
  destination network, then the configured egress interface is used. 
  </li>
  <li><code><b>set next hop verify-availability &lt;ip-address&gt; track 
  &lt;track-number&gt;</b></code>. Set the next hop if the IP SLA track is up.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to modification of the routing path of packets, PBR supports the 
following modifications to the header of IP packets;
<ul>
  <li><b>IP Precedence:</b> Modification of precedence attribute of IP packets 
  using the route-map command <code><b>set ip precedence</b></code>. The IP 
  header precedence setting determines how packets are treated by routers during 
  times of high traffic. When packets containing these headers arrive at another 
  router, the packets are ordered for transmission according to the precedence 
  set if queuing feature is enabled. Precedence bits are not honoured if queueing 
  is not enabled; in which case packet queueing will be based on FIFO. 
  The precedence value can be changed by using a name or number. Possible values 
  include: 
  <ul>
    <li>0 (routine)         </li>
    <li>1 (priority)        </li>
    <li>2 (immediate)        </li>
    <li>3 (flash)            </li>
    <li>4 (flash-override)  </li>
    <li>5 (critical)         </li>
    <li>6 (internet)         </li>
    <li>7 (network)          </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>DF bit:</b> The IP header DF bit can be modified using the command 
  <code><b>set ip df &lt;df&gt;</b></code>.</li>
  <li><b>VRF:</b> The VRF of a packet can be configured using the command 
  <code><b>set vrf &lt;vrf&gt;</b></code>.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
When PBR is configured, the PBR configured next hop takes precedence over the FIB table. 
</p>

</li>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Apply PBR</h2>
<p>
PBR can only be applied for IPv4 and IPv6 on the same interface using different 
route maps; they cannot co-exist on the same route map on the same interface. 
One route-map cannot have PBR configuration for IPv4 and IPv6 even 
though they are on separate route map statements of the same route map.f
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Inbound Traffic:</b>
The route-map is applied with the interface configuration command: 
<code><b>ip policy route-map &lt;route-map-name&gt;</b></code>
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R1(config)#<b>interface f4/1</b><br>
R1(config-if)#<b>ip policy route-map RM_PBR_172.31.0.1</b>
</code></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Locally-generated Traffic:</b> PBR for locally-generated traffic is 
applied using the global configuration command: <code><b>ip local policy route-map  
&lt;route-map-name&gt;</b></code>.
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R1(config)#<b>ip access-list extended ACL_172.31.0.0/24</b>                    <br>
R1(config-ext-nacl)#<b>30 permit udp host 192.168.1.1 host 172.31.0.1</b><br>
R1(config-ext-nacl)#<b>exit</b><br>
R1(config)#<b>ip local policy route-map RM_PBR_172.31.0.1</b>
</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h1>Reliable and Dynamic Path Control using PBR</h1>
<p>
To monitor network performance and change specific traffic paths that are based 
on the health of the network, you can use Cisco IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA)
in combination with PBR.
</p>


<h2>IP SLA</h2>
<p>
Create the probe using the command 
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
<b>#ip sla 1                                         <br>
#icmp-echo ipaddress source-ip ipaddress             <br>
#frequency 10                                        <br>
#show ip sla summary                                 <br>
#ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now       <br>
#show ip sla summary                                 <br>
#show ip sla configuration                           <br>
#show ip sla statistics                              <br>
</b>
</code></div>
<p>
IP SLA probes need to be enabled as they are disabled by default.
</p>
<h3>Create a Tracking Object</h3>
<p>
Tracking objects are used  to monitor probes.
<code>
#track 1 ip sla 1 reach
#delay down 10 up 3
#show track 
</code>
</p>
<p>
To apply the track in a route-map set command:
<code>
#set ip next-hop verify-availability 10.1.13.2 13.1.14.2 1 track 1 
</code>
</p>


<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>
show track. In the output, look out for section tracked by:
</p>

<h1>Verification of PBR</h1>
<p>
PBR can be verified by the following list of commands:
</p>


<h2><code>ping &lt;remote-ip-address&gt;</code></h2>
      <p>
        Tests PBR by generating traffic. Pings are usually sent using ICMP packets
        and these are matched in an extended ACL.
      </p>
