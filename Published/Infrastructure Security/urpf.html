 <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) is used to limit malicious traffic in
a network by blocking packets transiting a router having unknown source IP addresses. 
The design intention of uRPF is to block IP packets with spoofed or malformed
source IP addresses. It does this by checking the source IP address of packets 
arriving on an interface and determining whether the network of the source IP 
address is reachable using Layer 2 information in the Forwarding Information Base
(FIB). The FIB is generated by Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF). If the network of 
the packet source IP address is not reachable, the packet is dropped.
</p>
<p>
When forwarding traffic, by default, routers check for the reachability of a destination 
IP address prior to forwarding IP packets. With uRPF, the router validates reachability 
of the source IP address as well. uRPF can also be configured to verify whether the 
interface through which the packets entering the router is what the router would
normally use to send traffic back to IP addresses in that network.
</p>
<p>
For uRPF to function, CEF must be enabled globally (using the global configuration 
command <code><b>ip cef</b></code>).
</p>

<h1>How uRPF Works</h1>
<p>
The uRPF feature helps to mitigate problems caused by the introduction of malformed
or forged/spoofed IP source addresses into a network by discarding IP packets that 
lack a verifiable IP source address. A number of common Denial-of-Service (DoS) 
attacks such as smurf attacks, tribal Flood Network (TFN) attacks take advantage 
of forged or rapidly changing source IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
uRPF depends on CEF being enabled because the lookup relies on the FIB which is 
generated by CEF. uRPF is an input function and is applied only on the input
interface of a router at the upstream end of a connection.
</p>
<p>
uRPF checks to see if any packet received at a router interface arrives on the 
best return path to the source of the packet. uRPF does this by carrying out a 
reverse lookup in the CEF table. If the packet is received from one of the reverse
path routes, the packet is forwarded as normal.
</p>
<p>
If a reverse path for the packet is not found, the packet is dropped or forwarded 
depending on whether an ACL is specified in the URF configuration.
</p>
<p>
With uRPF, all equal cost return paths are considered valid. uRPF works in cases 
where multiple return paths exist provided that each path is equal to others in 
terms of routing cost, i.e. number of hops, cost etc. and as long as the route 
is in the FIB. uRPF also functions where EIGRP is configured with unequal cost 
routing.
</p>

<h1>Unicast RPF Operation Modes</h1>
<p>
uRPF operates in three modes: strict, loose and VRF modes. Some modes may not be 
available on some Cisco router models.
<ol>
    <li><b>Strict mode:</b> uRPF checks to ensure that the source IP address 
    is reachable based on the FIB table and the packet must also be arriving on 
    the same interface that the router would use to send traffic back to that IP
    address.
    Strict mode should only be used in conditions where no possibility of asynchronous 
    routing exists or else packets will be dropped. This is likely to occur in 
    BGP routing.</li>
    <li><b>Loose mode:</b> The router only verifies that the source IP address is
    reachable based on the FIB entry. The default route or route through the interface 
    Null0 are not included in this reachability check. If the route is not in the 
    RIB, the packet is dropped.</li>
    <li><b>VRF mode:</b> This mode is similar to loose mode operation but is 
    deployed in VRF environments. Interfaces in the same VRF as the receiving 
    interface are examined. This is commonly used in ISP networks for MPLS and BGP.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If an ACL is referenced in the uRPF configuration, it is checked when uRPF fails. 
If uRPF check fails and the packet is permitted by an ACL, it is transmitted. 
If the ACL is configured to block the traffic the packet is dropped after uRPF 
failure.
</p>

<h1>uRPF Configuration</h1>
<p>
uRPF is configured on the ingress interface using the command:
<code><b>ip verify unicast source reachable-via &lt;rx | any&gt; &lt;allow-default&gt; &lt;allow-self-ping&gt; &lt;ACL&gt;</b></code>
Where: 
<ul>
<li><b>rx:</b> enables strict mode</li>
<li><b>any:</b> enables loose mode</li>
<li><b>allow-default:</b> allows the use of a default route. 
By default, uRPF drops packets whose source IP address/network is reachable only 
via the default route. uRPF supports <code><b>allow-default</b></code> to accept 
a default route as a valid route.
It can be used in strict mode or loose mode.</li>
<li><b>allow-self-ping:</b> allows self-pinging when checking reachability of IP 
address. Cisco specifically discourages configuration of uRPF with allow-self-ping 
as it introduces security loopholes that can be leveraged for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</li>
</ul>
Do not configure strict mode on an uplink interface. Loose mode may be more appropriate in these case.

<h2>uRPF with Access Control Lists</h2>

<p>
To permit traffic that fails a uRPF check and is permitted by an access control list:
<ol>
  <li>Configure an access control list that permits traffic from the source network.</li>
  <li>Configure uRPF and reference the ACL.</li>
</ol>

<h2><code>show ip verify statistics</code></h2>
<p>
(Provides uRPF statistics on a PIX | ASA | FWSM firewall
</p>

<h1>Access Control Lists and Logging</h1>
<p>
If a packet fails the uRPF check, uRPF checks the linked ACL to see if the packet 
should be dropped (ACL deny statement) or forwarded (permit statement). Regardless
of whether the packet is dropped or forwarded, the packet is counted in global IP 
traffic statistics for unicast drops and in interface statistics for uRPF. To log 
uRPF events, specify the logging option for the ACL ACE. Using log info, administrators 
can view source addresses that are used in the attack, the time at which packets 
arrived on an interface.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Logging uRPF events for attacks that have a high rate of forged 
packets can degrade performance of the device.

<h1>Per-Interface Statistics</h1>
<p>
Per-interface statistics allow tracking of uRPF drops and uRPF suppressed drops. 
These statistics help identify the interface that is the entry point of the attacks.
Unicast suppressed drops are the count of packets that failed uRPF check but were 
permitted by ACLs.

<h1>Implementing Unicast RPF</h1>
<p>
uRPF implementation principles;
<ol>
  <li>Packets must be received on an interface that has the best return path to 
  the source (symmetric routing). There must be a route entry in the FIB matching the
  route to the receiving interface. ACLs permit uRPF to be used when packets are 
  known to be arriving by specific, less optimal asymmetric input paths.</li>
  <li>IP source addresses at the receiving interface must match the routing entry
  for the interface.</li>
  <li>uRPF is an input function and is applied only on the input interface of a 
  router at the upstream end of the network. </li>
</ol>
    </p>

<h2>Where to use uRPF</h2>
<p>
uRPF does not inspect IP packets encapsulated in tunnels such as GRE, L2TP, PPTP.
Configure uRPF so that it processes network traffic only after tunneling and 
encryption headers have been stripped from the packets.

uRPF can be used in any single-homed environment (symmetric routing). In such a 
case, uRPF is best used at the network perimeter for Internet, intranet and extranet.

uRPF on an ingress interface from the Internet protects an enterprise from packets
with malformed or spoofed source IP addresses from the Internet. If implemented 
in an ISP, it protects the ISP from spoofed packets from an enterprise.
</p>


 <h2>uRPF Types</h2> 
 <p>There are two types of uRPF:</p> 
 <ul> <li><strong>Ingress Filtering</strong>: Ingress filtering is applied to 
 incoming packets at the edge of a network. It's used to prevent IP spoofing attacks 
 from outside the network.</li> <li><strong>Egress Filtering</strong>: Egress 
 filtering is applied to outgoing packets at the edge of a network. It's used to 
 prevent IP spoofing attacks from within the network.</li> </ul> 
 
 <h2>Benefits of uRPF</h2> 
 <p>uRPF provides several benefits, including:</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li><strong>Prevention of IP Spoofing Attacks</strong>: uRPF prevents
 IP spoofing attacks by verifying the source IP address of incoming packets.</li> 
 <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Prevention</strong>: uRPF can prevent 
 DoS attacks by dropping packets with spoofed source IP addresses.</li> 
 <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack Prevention</strong>: uRPF can prevent 
 MitM attacks by dropping packets with spoofed source IP addresses.</li> 
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Limitations of uRPF</h2> 
 <p>uRPF has several limitations, including:
 <ul> 
 <li><strong>Asymmetric Routing</strong>: uRPF can cause issues with asymmetric 
 routing, where the return path of a packet is different from the forward path.</li> 
 <li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: uRPF can cause issues with load balancing,
 where a load balancer is used to distribute traffic across multiple servers.</li> 
 <li><strong>Network Complexity</strong>: uRPF can add complexity to network 
 configuration and management.</li>
 </ul>

 <h1>Best Practices for Implementing uRPF</h1> 
 <p>To implement uRPF effectively, follow these best practices:</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li><strong>Configure uRPF on Edge Routers</strong>: Configure uRPF on edge 
 routers to prevent IP spoofing attacks from outside the network.</li> 
 <li><strong>Use Strict Mode</strong>: Use strict mode to provide maximum security, 
 but be aware of potential issues with legitimate traffic.</li> 
 <li><strong>Monitor and Analyze Traffic</strong>: Monitor and analyze traffic 
 to identify potential issues with uRPF.</li> 
 <li><strong>Configure Exceptions</strong>: Configure exceptions for specific IP
 addresses or networks to bypass uRPF checks.</li> 
 </ul> 

<h1>Optimizing uRPF with ACLs</h1>
<p>
To leverage the available features of routers in providing protection against 
source IP address spoofing, it is recommended uRPF be configured along with the following:
<ol>
  <li>Configure ACLs to drop IP packets that have invalid source addresses 
  (ingress filtering)</li>
  <li>Configure ACLs to permit packets that fail the uRPF checks to allow specific 
  traffic from known asymmetric routed sources.</li>
  <li>Configure ACLs to track uRPF events by adding the logging option to the ACL. 
  This logging of denied or forwarded (suppressed drops) can provide additional 
  information about network attacks.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h1>Restrictions to uRPF</h1>
<p>
Basic restrictions to applying uRPF;
<ul>
 <li>Clients should not be multi-homed to the same router.</li>
 <li>Ensure that packets flowing up the link (to the Internet) match the route 
 advertised out the link.</li>
 <li>uRPF is available on platforms that support CEF.</li>
</ul>
uRPF is important particularly in ISPs.
