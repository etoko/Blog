<h1 id="INTRODUCTION">Introduction</h1>
<p>
Multiprotocol Label Switching  (MPLS) is a service provider packet forwarding technology for
routing customer traffic between different customer sites such as between the 
enterprise headquarters and branches or between the various enterprise branches. MPLS may also 
be used by enterprises to separate traffic between different business units using MPLS VPNs.
MPLS was developed to replace legacy remote-site-connectivity technologies  
such as ATM circuits, frame relay circuits, dedicated serial lines. 
 MPLS supports many layer 3 protocols including IP multicasts,unicasts and VPN.
Originally Cisco-proprietary, MPLS was referred to as tag switching. Cisco later 
handed it to IETF for open standardization. It is 
defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3031.txt" target="_blank">RFC 3031</a>.
</p>
<p>
MPLS provides support for the transportation of multiple payloads:
<ul>
  <li><b>Layer 2 payloads:</b> Ethernet  (Ethernet over MPLS), Frame Relay, ATM, PPP, HDLC, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Layer 3 payloads:</b> IPv4, IPv6, etc.</li>
  <li>Extensible to support future payloads.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By default, MPLS traffic will follow the same path as regular IP traffic would. This is because MPLS
uses the routing table to create paths through which to switch the labels. By default, all routes in
the routing table  (RIB) i.e. static, connected, and learned routes will have a label
assigned automatically when MPLS is configured on a router. MPLS can also be 
configured to generate labels only for specific networks. These locally generated 
labels are exchanged into the MPLS network by a label exchange protocol such as 
LDP  (label distribution protocol). MPLS operates like an overlay that attaches labels to 
known networks. MPLS uses these generated labels to move traffic throughout the 
MPLS domain; a process referred to as label switching.
</p>
<p>
Label switching feature of MPLS switches traffic between interfaces based on 
locally significant label values. This is similar to legacy virtual circuit 
switching in Frame Relay with input/output DLCI or ATM with input/output VPI/VCI.
</p>

<p>
When operating MPLS, it should never be run on client / customer-end of a connection unless the
client is another ISP.
</p>

<p>
MPLS consists of the MPLS data plane and the control plane: 
<ul>
<li>The <b>data plane</b> forwards MPLS labels within the MPLS network. By default, MPLS traffic follows the same path 
as regular IP traffic (in an IP network).
</li>
<li><b>Control plane</b> deals with how the labels are assigned and exchanged 
in the MPLS network. Label Distribution Protocol  (LDP) is the main open standard 
protocol used for label exchange between routers in the MPLS domain.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Need for MPLS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Without MPLS, customer sites would have to run eBGP sessions with the 
    service provider network to enable connectivity with remote sites.</li>
    <li>Implementation of MPLS makes it possible to implement tunneling over the 
    BGP free core. This saves routing table space on  the provider routers.</li>
    <li>With MPLS, it is possible to have transparent tunneling over the service provider network.</li>
    <li>Using MPLS, service providers are able to offer layer 2 and layer 3 VPN services to customers.</li>
<li>MPLS is more cost effective than legacy remote site connectivity options 
    such as dedicated serial links, Frame relay etc.</li>
    <li>MPLS provides the possibility of traffic engineering where: 
      <ul>
        <li>Load distribution can be carried out over under-utilized links.</li>
        <li>Give bandwidth guarantees.</li>
        <li>Route based on service type (QoS).</li>
        <li>Detect and repair failures quickly i.e., fast reroute (FRR).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="DATA_PLANE">Data Plane</h1>
<p>
All routers in an MPLS-domain are referred to as <b>Label Switched Routers  (LSRs)</b>.
<b>Ingress edge LSRs</b> are at the entry point of the MPLS domain where enterprise traffic enters 
the MPLS domain through the <b>provider edge  (PE) LSR</b>. The ingress LSR receives 
IP packets from the CE (customer-edge device) then adds MPLS labels to the 
packets based on the destination. The ingress LSR then switches the packet to 
the intermediate LSR in the data path using a label. The <b>egress edge LSR</b>
is the LSR of the service provider at the opposite end of the MPLS domain, 
from the ingress LSR, connecting 
to the CE at remote site of the customer; it is the 
LSR is at exit-end of the MPLS domain where customer traffic leaves the MPLS 
provider network towards the customer network. 
</p>
<p>
The MPLS label stack is deleted 
at the egress LSR and customer traffic is routed using IP. 
An MPLS-enabled router can act as both an ingress and egress LSR of traffic from 
the the same customer. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Intermediate LSRs</b> are in the 
middle of the MPLS domain. They are alternatively referred to as <b>P (provider) 
routers</b>. Intermediate LSRs interconnect the edge LSRs and 
forward network traffic primarily using labels.
A <b>Label Switched Path  (LSP)</b> is the complete end-to-end path that the labelled packet
will take through the MPLS domain  (unidirectional). The LSP for return traffic is 
usually the same as the transmit LSP. If asynchronous routing is implemented in 
the network, this return traffic LSP <b>may be different</b> for the original LSP.
</p>
<p>
MPLS forwarding reduces the lookup process by all routers in the path of a packet.

When a packet arrives at an ingress LSR, the Label Forwarding Information Base  (LFIB) is
consulted and the exit interface and label number is determined.
</p>
<h2>MPLS Devices</h2>
<p>
MPLS domains consist of three types of devices:
<ul>
  <li><b>Customer Edge (CE):</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>Usually the last hop device in the customer's network and connects to 
    the provider's network.</li>
    <li>MPLS is usually not configured on this device.</li>
    <li>It is configured for layer 2 or layer 3 connectivity services from MPLS
    i.e., device can be a switch or router.</li>
    </ul>
    
    </li>
  <li><b>Provider Edge (PE):</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Last hop router in the provider's network connecting the CE to the 
      P devices.</li>
      <li>PE performs IP routing lookups.</li>
      <li>PE devices share routes with the CE devices i.e., they have knowledge 
      of the customer's prefixes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Provider (P):</b>
    <ul>
     <li>Also referred to as Label Switch Routers (LSR)</li>
     <li>Core devices in the provider's network connecting the PEs.</li>
     <li>Switch traffic based on the labels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h1 id="CONTROL_PLANE">Control Plane</h1>
<p>
The control plane is responsible for exchanging MPLS labels with neighboring 
MPLS enabled devices (LSRs). This is accomplished using the label distribution protocol (LDP).
To operate effectively, MPLS requires the following; 
<ul>
<li>Routing table (RIB)</li>
<li>Label Information Base  (LIB)</li>
<li>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>MPLS Labels</h2>
<p>
An MPLS label is a 4-byte (32-bit) shim header inserted between the layer 2 and layer 3 
headers of an IP packet. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It is used to switch packets in the MPLS domain. It 
is defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3032.txt" target="_blank">RFC 3032</a>. 
It contains the following fields:
<ul>
<li><b>Label:</b> 20-bit field used for the Label number or ID and its value is locally significant.</li>
<li><b>Exp (Experimental bits):</b> 3 bit field used for QoS operations (Class of Service - CoS)</li>
<li><b>S bit:</b> 1 bit to indicate if a label is the last (bottom) in a stack.
MPLS supports multiple labels which are stacked. Sometimes referred to as BoS 
field by other network equipment vendors.
</li>
<li><b>Time To Live (TTL):</b> 8-bits field indicating the time to live (TTL). 
This field implements the same function as the TTL field in IP packets. It may 
also contain the same value.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
MPLS labels are bound to forwarding equivalency class  (FEC). The FEC is the 
binding between the IPv4 prefix and the MPLS label. 
A FEC can be mapped to multiple incoming labels to balance
loads, but a label represents only a single FEC on an LSR.

Routers in the MPLS domain use the LFIB to switch traffic instead of the routing table.
</p>
<p>
A label stack contains an ordered set of labels. The label close to the the Layer 2
header is called the outer label (or stack top label). The label close to the 
Layer 3 header is called the stack bottom label or inner label. This label has 
the S-bit set to 1.
</p>

</p>

<p>
PE and P devices perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li><b>Push:</b> a label is pushed onto the label stack. When inserting a new 
label, a push operation takes place. This may alternatively be known as label 
imposition. This operation is usually implemented by ingress LSRs and intermediate  
LSRs.</li>
<li><b>Swap:</b> The top-most label is swapped i.e., replaced with another label.
When switching packets, from 
one LSR to another towards the destination, swap operations take place. The 
label swap operation is usually implemented by intermediate LSRs.</li>
<li><b>Pop:</b> The top-most label is removed from the stack. Also known as label 
disposition. It is performed by the egress LSR. With penultimate hop popping, 
it is performed by the penultimate hop.</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> The entire label stack is destroyed on the packet  (resulting in a need for the packet to be
routed using IP).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All known networks are assigned a label locally identified by the Label ID. The 
assignable label ID is in the range <b>16 – 65,536</b>. <b>Labels IDs 1-15</b> are 
reserved. These labels are usually referred 
to as <b>transport labels</b>. This is in contrast to VPN labels used in MPLS Layer 3 VPNs 
 (L3VPN), where directly connected networks are flagged with the symbol [V] assigned next to 
the locally generated label to indicate that the label is a VPN label and not a
transport label. This VPN label is advertised to the PE LSR  (iBGP peer) at the 
other end of the L3VPN using BGP.
</p>
<p>
Labels are dynamically generated and uniquely assigned for every known network by each LSR
independent of the other LSRs. 
Different LSRs may assign a network the same label number. However, this does not 
cause any conflict during packet forwarding as the labels are unique to each LSR.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that each LSR assigns label IDs from a specific range that is 
unique to that particular LSR in the MPLS domain.  
This helps during troubleshooting to easily identify the LSR that a packet with 
a specific label originated from.
</p>

<h2>How Labels are Assigned</h2>
<p>
Data structures utilised by MPLS include; 
<ul> 
<li>Routing Information Base (RIB)</li>
<li>Forwarding Information Base (FIB) or CEF</li>
<li>Label Information Base (LIB)</li>
<li>Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB)</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Information from RIB  (Routing Information Base) is converted into a Layer 2 
data structure known as the forwarding information base (FIB)  
by Cisco Express Forwarding  (CEF). You can view this data structure by running 
the command <code><b>show ip cef</b></code>.
A directly connected network is assigned the label ID 3 which is also known as 
an <b>implicit null  (impl-null)</b>. 
The FIB, additionally, contains information on layer 2
to layer 3 mappings from sources such as ARP tables, frame relay maps etc. The LIB contains 
data from the RIB and label exchange protocols such as LDP, TDP, BGP, RSVP or 
static labels. The data from the LFIB is sourced from the LIB, RIB and FIB.
The FIB and LFIB are sourced from CEF.
</p>
<p>
For MPLS to switch packets, the IP network must be fully converged. MPLS will operate with 
any routing protocol such as RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, etc., including static routes.
If running MPLS with BGP, an IGP needs to be configured in the network. An LSR 
assigns a locally significant label for all 
connected prefixes and those learned from another routing protocol. The router 
will learn the downstream neighboring LSR's labels and store that label information as remote 
labels.
</p> 

<p>
When an IP packet enters the ingress LSR, a lookup of the  
Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB) takes place. The LFIB contains the networks, 
locally assigned labels, remote labels, next hop and exit interface. This information 
is sufficient to enable the LSR to switch received packets to towards their destination.
For example, given a packet B, the next hop is R2 and exit interface is g1/0 
with the label 53. The packet is then forwarded out the appropriate interface to
R2. In R2, the LFIB contains 53, destination R3 and exit interface G2/0 with 
label 71. When transmitting this packet, R2 will strip label 53 and replace it 
with label 71.

</p>

<h1 id="LABEL_EXCHANGE">Label Exchange</h1>
<p>
The two compatible label exchange protocols used for MPLS are label distribution 
protocol (LDP) and tag distribution protocol (TDP). Tag is the 
old name used by Cisco for labels. TDP is Cisco properietary while LDP is an 
open standard and supported by many vendors. The operation of TDP and LDP is 
identical. They share the same databases. IETF developed LDP based on TDP. 
Other label exchange protocols include: 
<ul>
  <li><b>MP-BGP:</b> defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3107.txt" target="_blank">RFC 3107</a> and advertises labels for BGP learned routes.</li>
  <li><b>RSVP:</b> defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3209.txt" target="_blank">RFC 3209</a> and is used for MPLS traffic engineering (MPLS TE).</li>
  <li>STATIC</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Label Distribution Protocol  (LDP)</h2>
<p>
Label Distribution Protocol  (LDP) is used to exchange labels with neighboring LSRs.
LDP advertises labels for IGP learned routes. It is defined by 
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5036.txt" target="_blank">RFC 5036</a>.
Like IGPs, LDP automatically discovers neighbors with a Hello protocol. Hello 
messages are sent in <b>multicast to IP address 224.0.0.2 (all routers) using UDP
port 646 and destination UDP port 646</b>. Hello messages include the "IPv4 transport address" 
field. This field 
defines the address to use for the TCP session. This address usually defaults to 
the LDP Router-ID which also defaults to the highest IP address of the loopback interface.
The LDP sessions are unicast using these transport addresses. These transport 
addresses could be modified, but this is usually not necessary.
</p>
<p>
Once the LDP session is established, the label is advertised for FEC i.e., 
label to IPv4 prefix mapping. Label distribution can be implicit or explicit;
 <ul>
   <li>Unsolicited downstream vs downstream on demand.</li>
   <li>Depends on implementation and config options.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 The ultimate result is that one label is assigned to learned prefixes. Labels 
 could be advertised for some or all routes. On Cisco devices, the default is 
 for all routes in the RIB<!-- IGP learned routes--> to have labels assigned. 
</p>
<p>
Label information is used to populate the Label Information
Base  (LIB) that MPLS uses to switch packets from source to destination in the 
MPLS domain.
LDP and TDP use TCP and UDP as their transport protocols. The LDP uses port number 
<b>646 for both UDP and TCP</b> communication. For TDP, the port number is <b>711 for UDP and TCP</b>.
TDP and LDP are nearly identical in their operation utilising the same tables. 
It is technically possible to have both TDP and LDP operating in different sections of an MPLS
domain and label switching will still take place.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that the MPLS control plane uses UDP to exchange 
information such as through the use of Hello messages, while 
the data plane sends information using TCP. 
</p>
<p>
An intermediate LSR in the MPLS domain that is connected to an egress LSR is known as a 
<b>penultimate hop</b>. The egress LSR gives directly connected networks a label 
with Label ID 3. This implicit null label is sent to the penultimate hop LSR.
When a penultimate hop receives a packet with a Label ID of 3  (implicit-null) 
from the egress LSR, it is a signal from the egress LSR that the penultimate hop
should delete the MPLS label before forwarding the packet to that egress LSR 
 (ultimate) using IP routing.
This causes the penultimate LSR to remove the label from the packet and sending 
an IP packet to the egress LSR. This process, known as <b>Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)</b>, 
avoids two lookups taking place on the egress LSR i.e., the MPLS label lookup in the 
Label Information Base  (LIB) and the route look-up from the routing table.
</p>
<h3>LDP Message Types</h3>
<p>
The various LDP message types include the following:
<ul>
  <li>Hello messages</li>
  <li>Label Address Mapping Message</li>
  <li>Initialization message</li>
  <li>Keepalive messages</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Depending on the size of the contents of the LDP message, 
it can contain more than one message type.</p>

<h4>Hello messages</h4>
<p>
Hello messages are used to detect neighboring LSRs. They contain information 
that is used when forming the LDP peering. Hello messages are sent, by default, every 5 seconds.
The LDP hello message is sent with the following parameters:
<ul>
  <li><b>Protocol:</b> UDP</li>
  <li><b>Source port:</b> 646</li>
  <li><b>Destination port:</b>646</li>
  <li><b>Source IP address:</b> exit interface IP</li>
  <li><b>Destination port:</b> 224.0.0.2 (all routers' multicast)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It contains the following fields;
<ul>
<li>LDP version</li>
<li>LSR ID</li>
<li>Hold time: default is 15 seconds</li>
<li>IP transport address: usually the LSR ID</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The following is a Wireshark packet 
capture of an LDP Hello message:

<h4>Initialization message</h4>
<p>
Initialization messages are sent at the start of the formation of the LDP peering 
session and are used to exchange capability information, session parameters
such as loop detection information, protocol version, configured max PDU length.
The initialization message is sent from the LDP TCP port 646 to an ephemeral 
port of the LDP peer. The source and destination IP addresses are the LSR IDs of 
the peers.
</p>
<p>
LDP session parameters are exchanged between neighboring routers during the start 
of the formation of the LDP peering session. These parameters include:
<ul>
  <li>Session protocol: usually version 1</li>
  <li>Session keepalive time: usually 180</li>
  <li>Session receiver LSR ID: The LDP ID of the detected neighboring LSR. This 
  information is obtained from the received LDP hello messages</li>
  <li>Session receiver label space identifier.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
LDP intialization messages are sent using the following parameters:
<ul>
  <li><b>Transport protocol:</b> TCP</li>
  <li><b>TCP Source port:</b> ephemeral</li>
  <li><b>TCP Destination port:</b> 646</li>
  <li><b>Source IP address:</b> LDP ID</li>
  <li><b>Destination IP address:</b> neighbor's LDP IP</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Keep Alive Message</h4>
<p>
LSRs that have formed a TCP session periodically send keepalive messages to 
maintain the session. By default, these keepalive messages are sent every 60
seconds on Gigabit-Ethernet interfaces. The default holdtime is 180 seconds. If
Keep Alive messages are not received from a peer after 180 seconds, the LDP 
session gets terminated.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that because the Initialization message and Keep Alive 
messages are sent using TCP, the LDP peer will send a TCP ACK message when it 
receives the Initialization or Keep Alive messages.
</p>

<p>
These are sent to maintain the LDP session between LSRs. They are sent in 90 - 100 
second intervals. The keepalive message type is sent with the following paramters:
<ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Transport protocol:</b> TCP</li>
  <li><b>TCP Source port:</b> 646</li>
  <li><b>TCP Destination port:</b> ephemeral</li>
  <li><b>Source IP address:</b> LDP ID</li>
  <li><b>Destination IP address:</b> neighbor's LDP IP</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following is a Wireshark packet capture of a KeepAlive 
message:

<h3>LDP Sessions</h3>
<p>
When MPLS is enabled, LSR Hello messages start being sent out of configured interfaces
using UDP.
The LDP hello messages are sent with the following information:
<ul>
<li><b>destination IP address:</b> all-routers multicast address <b>224.0.0.2</b>.</li>
<li><b>destination port:</b> UDP port 646.</li>
<li><b>source IP address:</b> the IP address of the exit interface.</li>
<li><b>source port:</b> UDP 646.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
After the exchange of LDP hellos, the LSRs attempt to form a TCP session.
The LSR with a higher LSR ID becomes the active router and initiates the TCP 
three-way handshake to start the formation of a TCP session.
LSRs form TCP sessions with each other using port 646.
Communication between any two LSRs to form an adjacency is done using the LDP ID.

The LSR with the higher LSR ID becomes the Active LSR i.e. it initiates the TCP session.
Therefore, unlike routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, the LSR ID should be a routable
IP address. 
An IGP should, therefore, advertise the IP addresses on the loopback interfaces 
for MPLS to fully function.

A deterministic TCP session is initiated between the two LSRs.
Once the TCP session has been created, LDP messages such as Initialization, 
Keepalive, Address Message, exchanged using TCP.
</p>
<p>
Only one TCP session is formed between two LSRs regardless of the number of 
routing paths between them. The reason for having the TCP session is that the two 
LSRs may have multiple interconnecting links through which hello messages are sent. 
This helps with preventing multiple sessions between the same LSRs.
The TCP session between the LDP peers can be verified using the command: 
<code><b>show tcp brief</b></code>
</p>

<p>
IOS uses
unsolicited exchange of labels with liberal retention. Neighbor LSRs exchange the contents of their
locally-assigned labels, Liberal retention implies that an LSR keeps label information that it does
not use/need for example, a downstream LSR receiving a label for a further downstream route
from an upstream LSR.

The LFIB table is built from Routing Information Base  (RIB), Forwarding Information Base  (FIB)
and Label Information Base  (LIB) tables. On egress edge LSR, a connected network has no LFIB
entry. It uses IP for normal routing.
</p>
<p>
LDP sessions can be verified using the command <code><b>show mpls ldp neighbor</b></code>.
</p>




<h3>Building the MPLS Domain</h3>
<p>
MPLS runs with any routing protocol, though, Interior Gateway Protocols  (IGPs) specifically link-
state routing protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS are recommended for optimum operation. MPLS is
as fast as the convergence of routing protocols.

A layer 2 data structure i.e. CEF FIB is a representation of the routing table. When MPLS is
enabled, entries are made to the CEF table. Disabling CEF on a router breaks MPLS because labels
are assigned to every entry in the CEF table.

From a client Cisco IOS device, to verify the MPLS operation, run the 
<code><b>traceroute</b></code> 
command to a destination on the other end of an MPLS network.

During label switching, local labels are not used to make switching decisions. They are used by
downstream LSR.
</p>

<h2 id="CONFIGURATION">Configuration</h2>
<p>
MPLS has the following prerequisites;
<ul>
<li>Fully operational IP routing: In the following configuration, it is assumed that 
IP routing is enabled using a routing protocol.</li>
<li>IP CEF</li>
<li>Label exchange on interfaces using a protocol such as LDP or TDP.</li>
</ul>

The following topology is used for the MPLS configurations. It has a fully 
converged OSPF network.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Step 1: Enable IP CEF</h3>
<p>Without the CEF database, the LIB will not be created making MPLS operation not possible.
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>ip cef distributed</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
The <code><b>distributed</b></code> keyword is optional.
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Configure the LSR ID</h3>
<p>
By default, LDP selects the IP address of the highest loopback interface 
as the LSR ID. However, the LSR ID can be explicitly configured using the global 
configuration command: <code><b>mpls ldp router-id &lt;interface&gt; force</b></code>.
<code><b>interface</b></code> is the interface whose IP address is to be used 
as LSR ID.
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>mpls ldp router-id loopback255 force</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
It is recommended to use IP addresses configured on loopback interfaces as LSR IDs 
because they are always up. MPLS, by default, uses the highest IP address of any 
active loopback interface as the LSR ID. It is important to note that the IP 
address used as an LSR ID should be reachable from a neighboring LSR or else no neighborship can be formed.
The LSR ID must be reachable as it will be used in the establishment of the TCP 
session between neighboring LSRs.
</p>

<h3>Step 3  (Optional): Define a label range</h3>
<p>
A label range refers to the range of label ID values that the LSR can use when 
creating labels. To help with troubleshooting efforts or ease of 
network traffic monitoring, the label ranges for each LSR needs to be unique. 
Additionally, the label range should be wide enough to enable the creation of 
unique label IDs for all IGP learned routes. This ensures that the LSR does not 
run out of Label ID values to use for newly learned networks.
<b>Tip:</b> Try to configure the label range so that the source of the label is 
instantly recognisable, for example, on LSR R1 the range can be 1000-1999, R2: 2000–2999 etc: 
<code><b>mpls label range &lt;16 – 1048575&gt;</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>mpls label range 1000 1999</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
If MPLS is already operational and you would like to define MPLS label ranges 
for LSRs, MPLS will have to be turned off and turned on for the configured label 
range to start being used.<br>
<b>Take extra caution when doing this on a production network.</b>
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Configure the label exchange protocol</h3>
<p>
Enable LDP on the appropriate interface using the interface command <code><b>mpls label 
protocol ldp</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
      	R1(config)#<b>interface gigabitethernet0/0</b> <br>
      	R1(config-if)#<b>mpls label protocol ldp</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
It is possible to migrate from one label exchange protocol to another.
To change protocol from using LDP to TDP;
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>interface gigabitethernet1/1</b><br>
R1(config-if)#<b>mpls label protocol tdp</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
One of the main differences between LDP and TDP is  
LDP supports authentication while TDP does not support authentication.
</p>



<h3>Step 5: Enable MPLS</h3>
<p>
MPLS is enabled using the global command: <code><b>mpls ip</b></code> and on 
the specific interfaces as well;
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>mpls ip</b>
</code></div>
<p>
OSPF and IS-IS  (link-state protocols) support the activation of MPLS from within the routing
protocol configuration. In OSPF router configuration mode, this is accomplished using the
command; <code><b>mpls ldp autoconfig area &lt;area-id&gt;</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>router ospf 1</b><br>
R1(config-router)#<b>mpls ldp autoconfig area 0</b>
</code></div>
</p>

<p>
The optional <code><b>area &lt;area-id&gt;</b></code> adds the flexibility of 
enabling LDP on interfaces in the configured OSPF area.
</p>

<p>
Another alternative is to configure the autoconfiguration at the interface:
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
 <code>
 R1(config)#<b>interface g0/0</b><br>
 R1(config-if)#<b>mpls ldp igp autoconfig</b>
 </code></div>
</p>

<p>
Synchronization between the IGP and LDP can be configured:
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
 <code>
 R1(config)#<b>interface g0/0</b><br>
 R1(config-if)#<b>mpls ldp igp sync delay &lt;5-60&gt;</b>
 </code></div>
</p>
<p>
The optional delay parameter (in seconds) can be configured so that LDP synchronizes with the 
IGP after the configured delay interval. This can help guard against synchronizing 
due to a flapping route.
</p>

<p>
Note that setting the label range on an LSR that has an active TCP session with another LSR will
not take effect immediately. To enforce the new label range; disable MPLS on the 
interface using the command <code><b>no mpls ip</b></code>, 
then enable MPLS on the interface. However, if MPLS was enabled through the routing
protocol, then disabling LDP in the interface with the interface sub-mode command 
<code><b>no mpls ip</b></code> will return the following message;
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R7(config)#<b>interface g2/0</b>                                               <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>no mpls ip</b>                                                <br>
%LDP remains enabled on interface Gi2/0 by autoconfig.                  <br>
Autoconfig can be removed from Gi2/0 with 'no mpls ldp igp autoconfig.' 
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
As indicated in the message, to completely disable LDP on such interfaces, issue the following
command in interface sub-mode;
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R7(config-if)#<b>interface g2/0              </b>          <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>no mpls ldp igp autoconfig  </b>          <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>exit                        </b>          <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls ip                             </b>    <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls label protocol ldp             </b>    <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls label range 7000 7999          </b>    <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls ldp router-id loopaback10 force</b>    <br>
R7(config)#<b>interface g2/0                      </b>    <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>mpls ip</b>
</code></div>
</p>


<h3>Configuration Example</h3>
<p>
The configuration snippets are based on the following network;

Configuration edge LSR R7, the following configuration activates MPLS on interfaces
GigabitEthernet 2/0, GigabitEthernet 3/0 and FastEthernet6/0.

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R7(config)#<b>ip cef                             </b>  <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls ip                            </b>  <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls label protocol ldp            </b>  <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls label range 7000 7999         </b>  <br>
R7(config)#<b>mpls ldp router-id Loopback10 force</b>  <br>
R7(config)#<b>interface gigabitethernet 3/0   </b>     <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>mpls ip                      </b>     <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>interface gigabitethernet 2/0</b>     <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>mpls ip                      </b>     <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>interface fastethernet 6/0   </b>     <br>
R7(config-if)#<b>mpls ip </b>
</code></div>
</p>

<h2 id="AUTHENTICATION">Authentication</h2>
<p>
LDP supports authentication and by default, MD5 is used to hash the password. To configure
authentication, use the global configuration command <code><b>mpls ldp neighbor 
&lt;ip-address&gt; password &lt;password&gt;</b></code>;
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>mpls ldp neighbor 30.255.2.2 password simplesimple</b>
</code></div>
</p>

<p>
The output confirms that authentication has been configured:

<p>
Configuration of authentication on one end of an active LDP session may not take down the TCP
session between the neighbors on some versions of IOS. To reset the LDP session and force the
authentication reequirement, run the following command;

<h3>Label Forwarding Information Base  (LFIB)</h3>
<p>
The LFIB is created using information from the LIB, RIB and FIB.
It operates at the data plane of MPLS.
The LFIB is displayed using the command <code><b>show mpls forwarding-table</b></code>.
The LFIB table shows the number of packets switched by MPLS. It also displays
the LDP, TDP receive labels. ‘No Label’ indicates that the LSR on which this command 
is executed will perform PHP for traffic to these networks.

The "Pop Label" value indicates that the label stack will be deleted.

<h3>Trace the LSP</h3>
<p>
The <code><b>traceroute</b></code> command can be used to confirm the end-to-end operation 
of label switching.
When an ICMP packet is sent and the TTL packet expires at a hop, 
the value of the labels is placed in the ICMP packets. This is displayed in the 
traceroute ICMP expired packet.

To verify operation of MPLS, issue a traceroute from R1 to R8:

<p>
LSRs can be configured to not include the label IDs in the ICMP replies for locally 
generated traffic or transit traffic or both. This is accomplished using the global 
configuration command <code><b>no mpls ip propagate-ttl local|forwarded|cir</b></code>:
<ul>
<li><code><b>local:</b></code> ICMP replies will not contain label IDs for locally generated traffic.</li>
<li><code><b>forwarded:</b></code> ICMP replies will not contain label IDs for transit traffic; this option is usually 
  configured in service provider networks to hide the MPLS details from the clients.</li>
<li><code><b>CIR:</b></code> applies to both.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
At the penultimate LSR, CEF does not show a label for the destination network; 
the command <code><b>show mpls ldp binding</b></code> displays this as  <code><b>‘impl-null’</b></code> 
label and <code><b>mpls forwarding-table</b></code> displays <code><b>‘Pop label’</b></code>.

By default, the Layer 3 TTL value of a packet is copied to the MPLS header TTL section.
</p>

<h3>Label Information Base  (LIB)</h3>
<p>
The LIB operates at the MPLS control plane. If BGP is used for label exchange, 
then the command is <code>
<b>show ip bgp labels</b></code>
</p>

<h3>LDP Discovery</h3>
<p>
The command <code><b>show mpls ldp discovery</b></code> displays the LSR's LDP ID 
and neighboring LSRs and the respective interfaces through which the neighbor LSR 
is reachable. If the interface status shows <code><b>xmit</b></code>, then the LSR neighbor relationship 
has a problem. Hello messages are no longer being received on the interface from this 
neighbor. An interface's operational status should be <code><b>xmit/recv</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
The LDP ID values has the suffix value of zero(0). This value will always be zero
unless running MPLS in cell mode which require specially configured ATM interfaces. 
This command also verifies the exchange of Hello messages using UDP.

<h3>LDP Neighbors</h3>
<p>
LDP peers can be viewed using the command <code><b>show mpls ldp neighbor</b></code>.


 To view neighboring LSRs. The optional <code><b>detail</b></code> shows authentication information.
    This command also verifies the operational state of the TCP session between
    the LDP neighbors.

The configuration of a password can be verified using the command 
<code><b>show mpls ldp neighbor detail</b></code>. From the output of this 
command, the stale state indicates that the configuration of the password has 
not been enforced. Applying the configuration using the 
command <code><b>R7#clear mpls ldp neighbor &lt;ip-address | * &gt;</b></code> 
results in the output showing the  status of <code><b>in-use</b></code>.

<h2>LDP Neighbors not forming</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><code><b>show mpls ldp neighbor </b></code>
    to identify neighbors.</li> 
<li><code><b>show mpls interface</b></code>: to identify if MPLS is running</li>
<li>traceroute</li>
<li>Ensure that the LDP ID is reachable; of the local LSR or remote LSR.
    To easily identify where MPLS is broken, go the one PE and <code><b>
    ping mpls ipv4 </b></code> to the remote PE device. Status code of B indicates that the packet was sent 
    using unlabelled output.
    On affected LSR, use <code><b>show mpls interfaces</b></code>.
    </li>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<!--
<p>
IP troubleshooting tools may not necessarily resolve MPLS issues. such ping, 
traceroute, show ip route. When troubleshootnig MPLS use MPLS troubleshooting tools;
troubleshoot MPLS dataplane and control plane separately. 

Control plane: do you have neighbors, routing plane operationa?, MPLS enabled, 
correct info in databases.

Dataplane: follow the labels, are the correct labels

MPLS tools include MPLS databases, ping, does the intermediate node have a route 
back to the source to send ICMP packets.
</p>
-->
<p>
When troubleshooting MPLS data plane traffic, follow the labels when running the traceroute
command. If run from a customer to customer site, the first label is the transport label, the second
label is the Layer 3 VPN  (L3VPN) .

A fast way of identifying where LDP is broken at the PE LSR is to run the command;
<code><b>ping mpls ipv4 &lt;remote-PE-loopback&gt; source &lt;local-loopback&gt; verbose</b></code>.

A code ‘B’ indicates unlabelled output interface.

To cause LDP to use a physical interface IP address instead of LDP ID, issue the
following command;
</p>
<p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
      	<code>
R1(config)#<b>interface g0/0</b> <br>
R1(config-if)#<b>mpls ldp discovery transport-address interface</b>
</code></div>
</p>
<p>
With the above command, the router ID  (LDP ID) is the loopback but the TCP session uses the
interface IP
</p>
