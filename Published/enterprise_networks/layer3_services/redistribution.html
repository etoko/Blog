<h1>Redistribution</h1>
<p> 
Redistribution is the process of taking routes from the routing table and injecting
them into a routing protocol. The source of the injected routes could be any 
of: connected routes, static routes or routes from another routing protocol that 
are in the routing table (RIB). Sourcing routes from the RIB implies that;
<ol type="a">
  <li>the best routes are redistributed.</li>
  <li>Loop-free routes are redistributed.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<P>
The routing device performing the redistribution participates in the routing domain of 
the source and destination of the redistributed routes; for instance, if redistributing
routes from OSPF into BGP, the redistributing device participates in the OSPF 
routing domain as well as the BGP routing domain.
</p>
<h1>Reasons for Redistribution</h1>
<p>
An enterprise may implement redistribution for one or more of the following reasons:
<ol type="i">
  <li>A company merger where the networks of both companies run different 
  routing protocols.</li>
  <li>Different organizational department networks are under different network 
      administrative control perhaps based on geography.</li>
  <li>An organization inter-connecting with partner networks</li>
  <li>Hardware constraints such routing devices with low memory, CPU.</li>
  <li>During conversion or migration from one routing protocol to another.</li>
  <li>Mixed vendor environment.</li>
  <li>Support for legacy equipment in the network.</li>
  <li>Application-specific protocols support.</li>
  <li>IGP routes may need to be advertised into BGP.</li>
  <li>Some BGP routes may need to be advertised into an IGP.</li>
  <li>Political boundaries.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Types of Redistribution</h1>
<p>
Redistribution can be implemented in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Unidirectional Redistribution (one-way redistribution):</b> 
  routes are redistributed from the source to the destination protocol on a 
  single routing device in one direction. Conceptually, this type of 
  redistribution is similar to multipoint one-way redistribution where redistribution
  is implemented on more than one routing device but in the same direction i.e. 
  from source X to destination Y.</p>
  <p>
  Creation of routing loops in one-way redistribution is not possible.
  Usually one way redistribution occurs when redistributing from a source that 
  is not a routing protocol such as default routes or static routes. Rarely is 
  one-way redistribution implemented with the source being a routing protocol.
  </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Mutual Redistribution (two-way redistribution):</b> Mutual redistribution
 occurs when routes from routing protocol X are injected into routing protocol Y 
 and routes sourced from routing protocol Y are injected into routing protocol X 
 on the same routing device. 
 Mutual redistribution can be thought of as a form of route conversion.
 Mutual redistribution can be implemented on a single routing device in the
 network (single-point two-way redistribution) or on two or more routing devices 
 (multipoint two-way redistribution).</p>
 <p>
 Multipoint mutual redistribution has a high-potential for introducing 
 routing loops. These routing loops can be prevented from occuring using: 
 access-lists or prefix-lists referenced by route-maps. 
 One of the most scalable solutions for preventing routing loops introduced by 
 route redistribution is through the use of route-tags.</p>
 </li>
 <p>
 Mutual multipoint redistribution provides the benefit of fault-tolerence where 
 the failure of a redistributing device at one point does not affect traffic across 
 both routing domains.
 </p>
 </ul>

 <h1>Redistribution Rules</h1>
 <p>
 <ol>
   <li><b>Redistribution is not transitive:</b> Routes that have been redistributed 
   into a routing protocol can not be further redistributed into a third routing 
   protocol on the same routing device. 
   To resolve this, mutual redistribution should be configured between 
   routing protocol A and B, B and C and A with C.</li>
   <li><b>Sequential redistribution is allowed when it is spread across multiple
   routers:</b> Redistributed routes from protocol A into Protocol B on Router R1.
   These routes can be redistributed into protocol C on router R2.</li>
   <li>Routes to be redistributed must be in the routing table.</li>
 </ol>
 </p>

 
<h1>Seed Metric</h1 >
<p>
During redistribution, metric information of the redistributed routes is lost 
because the different routing protocols calculate route metrics using different 
methods. Route metrics are only maintained when redistribution occurs from one 
routing process or autonomous system to another with the same routing protocol. 
</p>
<p>
Seed metric is assigned, by default, to redistributed routes, when no metric 
is manually configured.
 The redistribution metric of redistributed routes can be configured in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>Using the <code><b>metric</b></code> keyword of the <code><b>redistribution
    </b></code> command.</li>
    <li>Configuration of a default metric where all redistributed routes into 
    the destination routing protocol receive the configured default seed metric.
    This can be implemented using the command <code><b>default-metric</b></code>.
    <li>Using a route-map with the <code><b>metric</b></code> command.</li>
  </ul>
The recommended best practice from Cisco is to set a default metric when 
redistributing routes.
</p>
<P>
The following table shows the seed metric of routes when redistributing from one 
routing protocol to another.

<p>* The IGP metric becomes the MED path attribute of the prefix.</p>

<p>
Routes with the default redistribution metric of infinity are installed into the 
Link-state database (OSPF), BGP table (BGP) or similar data structures of the 
destination routing protocol. These routes are not inserted into the routing 
table because they are considered unreachable due to their metric of infinity.
EIGRP does not add routes with infinity metric to its topology table.
</p
<p>
When redistributing between two same routing protocols but different processes or 
autonomous systems, the metric remains unchanged because the destination protocol
understands the metric of the source protocol. For example OSPF process 1 to 
OSPF process 2, the metric of the redistributed routes remains the same.
</p>
<p>
When redistributing connected networks (on local interfaces), 
</p>

 
<h1>Configuration of Redistribution</h1>
<p>
When redistributing routes into a routing protocol from another routing domain, 
there are many controls that can be implemented that the redistribution point 
such as tagging, metric configuration, filtering of redistributed routes. 
</p>
<p>
When configuring redistribution, redistribution commmands are entered into the 
router configuration mode of the destination routing protocol. 
In a way, the redistribution configuration command says:
"Redistribute routes from the specified routing source into this routing source."
</p>

<h2>EIGRP</h2>
<p>
Any route that is in the EIGRP topology table is a candidate 
for redistribution. Routes redistributed into EIGRP are given a default seed 
metric of infinity. This prevents the routes from being installed into the EIGRP
topology table. The exception to this is when redistributing routes from one 
EIGRP autonomous system to another. In such a scenario, the path metric is maintained.
</p>

<p>
In IOS, routes redistributed into EIGRP have an administrative distance of 170.
This administrative distance is the same regardless of the source routing 
protocol i.e. even if the source of the prefixes was another EIGRP autonomous 
system.
</p>

<p>
Redistribution is configured under the EIGRP router command:
</p>
<p>
<code><b>redistribute &lt;source&gt;  &lt;metric&gt; &lt;bandwidth&gt; &lt;delay&gt; &lt;reliability&gt; &lt;load&gt; &lt;mtu&gt; route-map &lt;route-map_name&gt;</b></code> 
</p>
<p>
where <code><b> &lt;source&gt; </b></code> is the source of the redistributed routes. 
</p>
<!--
<p>
In EIGRP named mode, redistribution is configured under topology base 
configuration mode as shown below:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R2(config)#<b>router eigrp EIGRP_NAMED</b><br>
R2(config-router)#<b>address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 1</b><br>
R2(config-router)#<b>topology base</b><br>
R2(config-router-af-topology)#<b>redistribute ospf 1</b><br>
</code>
</div>
-->
<p>
In EIGRP classic mode, redistribution is configured under EIGRP router configuration 
mode as shown below:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R2(config)#<b>router eigrp 1</b><br>
R2(config-router)#<b>redistribute ospf 1</b><br>
</code>
</div>
<p>
When configuring the EIGRP redistribution seed metric, delay value is in tens of
microseconds.
</p>
<p>
When redistributing BGP routes into EIGRP, the administrative tag is set to the 
autonomous system number of the BGP device that sent the prefixes.
</p>

<p>
EIGRP requires the configuration of a seed metric during redistribution.
If the seed metric is not included in the redistribution, EIGRP will give the 
route a metric of infinity.
</p>
<p>
In IPv4, by default, connected routes that are associated with EIGRP will have 
their configured network addresses included in a redistribution. However, with 
IPv6, by default, they are not included redistributed.
Some connected interfaces may not necessarily be destination networks for network 
traffic such as transit networks. However, during redistribution, it may be a 
good idea to redistribute these networks as well as it may sometimes result 
in traffic blackholing. This is especially likely when utilising some tunneling 
techniques such as MPLS tunneling.
</p>
<p>
Redistribution of routes into EIGRP can be implemented using the following 
EIGRP routing device command: <code><b>redistribute &lt;source&gt; metric 
&lt;bandwidth delay reliability load mtu&gt;</b></code>

<h2>OSPF</h2>
<p>
In OSPF, the routing device that redistributes external routes into OSPF is 
referred to as an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR).</p>
</p>
<p>
When redistributing routes into OSPF, redistributed routes are given an  
administrative distance of 110 and are flagged as OSPF external routes. The AD 
is similar to the administrative distance 
of intra-area and inter-area routes. 
When making forwarding decisions for routes from multiple sources, OSPF's 
prefix selection process gives preference in the following order:
<ol>
  <li>intra-area routes</li>
  <li>inter-area routes</li>
  <li>external routes</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>external type 1 routes</li>
    <li>external type 2 routes</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The metric for OSPF external type 1 routes equals the redistribution metric plus 
the total path metric to the autonomous system boundary router. The metric for 
OSPF external type 2 metric equals only the redistribution metric. If two type 2 routes have 
the same metric, then the one with the lower forwarding cost is preferred. 
This is the default external metric type used by OSPF.
</p>
<p>
When configuring redistribution into OSPF, the OSPF router mode command <code><b>
redistribute</b></code> is used.
</p>
<div>
<code><b>
redistribute &lt;source&gt; subnets metric &lt;metric&gt; metric-type (&lt;1 | 2&gt;)
tag &lt;0 - 4294967295&gt; route-map &lt;route-map-name&gt;
</b></code>
</div>
<p>
Where:
<ul>
<li>source: the source of routes</li>
<li>metric: seed metric of the redistributed routes</li>
<li>route-map: filtering can be applied using the route-map or route path 
information</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In older IOS versions, if the optional subnets command is excluded, only classful 
routes are advertised. In newer IOS versions, the subnets keyword is automatically
added by the IOS into the running configuration.
</p
<p>
Redistributing routes between OSPF processes will preserve the path metric during 
redistribution regardless of the metric type.
</p>
<p>
To inject EIGRP sourced routes into OSPF:
</p>
<div style="background-color:#f4f0ec; border-style:solid;border-width:1px;border-color:#D3D3D3">
<code>
R2(config)#<b>router ospf 1</b><br>
R2(config-router)#<b>redistribute eigrp 1 subnets</b>
</code>
</div>
<h3>OSPF Forwarding Address</h3>
<p>
By default, packets destined for external destinations are routed through the 
advertising autonomous  system boundary router (ASBR). Scenarios like 
this are not optimal in certain circumstances. By default, OSPF sets the 
forwarding address value to 0.0.0.0. The forward address can be viewed using the 
command <code><b>show ip ospf database external</b></code>.
</p>

<p>
OSPF will change the forwarding address from 0.0.0.0 to the next-hop IP address 
in the source routing protocol when: 
<ul>
  <li>OSPF is enabled on the ASBR's interface that points to the next-hop IP 
  address of the redistributed routes.</li>
  <li>The interface is not set to passive.</li>
  <li>The OSPF interface type is set to a broadcast or non-broadcast type.</li>
</ul>
Enabling OSPF on R2's interface facing towards R1 (10.123.1.1) changes the 
forwarding address from 0.0.0.0 to the interface pointed towards R1. The 
forwarding-address changes on R3 irrespective of whether redistribution is 
configured on R3.
</p>

<p>
When redistributing OSPF prefixes into another routing protocol, IOS provides
the option to match internal, external or NSSA-external routes. This can be 
useful in preventing the redistribution of external OSPF routes into another 
routing protocol.
</p>
<p>
When redistributing into OSPF, the optional subnets keyword results in subnets 
being included in the redistribution. In newer IOS versions the subnets keyword
is automatically included by default if the keyword was not configured.
</p>
<h3>OSPF External Route Types</h3>
<p>
OSPF classifies redistributed routes as external type 1 and external type 2 routes.
By default, OSPF classifies routes as external type 2 routes.
</p>
<p>
OSPF issues redistributed routes with a default metric of 20.
OSPF external type 1 routes are redistributed with the default metric of 20 and 
maintain this same metric throughout the OSPF autonomous system. OSPF external 
type 2 routes have a default metric of 20 or configured redistribution metric. 
However, as the routes are distributed within the OSPF domain, the metric does 
not increase.

<h2>BGP</h2>
<p>
Redistributing routes into BGP does not require a seed metric because it is a 
path vector protocol. Redistributed routes have the following BGP attributes set:
<ul>
  <li>Origin is set to incomplete</li>
  <li>Next-hop address is set to the next-hop IP address identified in the source protocol.</li>
  <li>The weight is set to 32,768.</li>
  <li>The MED is set to the path metric of the source protocol.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Redistributing routes from OSPF to BGP does not include OSPF external routes by 
default. The optional <code><b>match external (1 | 2)</b></code> keyword is 
required to redistribute OSPF external routes. The type of OSPF external routes 
can be configured using <code><b> 1 or 2</b></code> to redistribute type-1 or 
type-2 routes only.

    routes are redistributed into BGP. To redistribute external and nssa-external 
    OSPF routes into BGP, list route type after the redistribute 
    <code><b>match</b></code> keyword. With the <code><b>match</b></code> keyword

    match can be configured in a route-map.

<h1>Formation of Loops</h1>
<p>
If redistribution happens at one point (one routing device) or two points in one direction, the possibility 
of a routing loop does not exist. If mutual redistribution at more than one point occurs, 
then the possibility of loop formation exists.
</p>
<p>
Route feedback occurs when a redistributed route is advertised back into  
the original source routing protocol. Route feedback is likely to occur in 
networks where mutual redistribution is implemented in more than one device i.e.
multipoint mutual redistribution. Route feedback causes:
<ul>
  <li>Sub-optimal routing</li>
  <li>Routing loops</li>
  <li>Invalid routing tables</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Types of Loops</h2>
<p>
Loops exist in two categories: 
<ul>
<li><b>Control-plane:</b> exist when routing information is looping.
Control-plane loops are detected using the <code><b>debug ip routing</b></code> 
command. This command is largely silent. However, it will display when a route 
is added or removed from the routing table. If this happens repeatedly, then we 
can be certain that we are dealing with a loop. Redistribution should be done 
after observing the <code><b>debug ip routing</b></code> output for a while.
</li>
<li>
<b>Data-plane:</b> occur when data packets are looping. The best way to detect 
data-plane loops is to use the <code><b>ping</b></code> and <code><b>
traceroute</b></code> commands. If traffic is being dropped, then 
a black hole exists. Looped packets may include packets for known networks (in RIB)
or unknown networks (default route). With mutual multipoint redistribution, it 
is also likely that the default route may be looped.
</li>
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting Loops</h2>
<p>
Mutual multipoint route redistribution usually forms routing loops. The following 
techniques can be used to prevent the formation of routing loops during 
redistribution:
<ol>
  <li>Filtering of network prefixes during redistribution.</li>
  <li>Filtering by route tag during redistribution</li>
  <li>Increasing the seed metric</li>
  <li>Modifying the administrative distance.</li>
  <li>Route summarization</li>
</ol>
When troubleshooting routing loops:
<ul>
  <li>Multiple techniques can be combined.</li>
  <li>Document the physical and logical topology to include the routing 
  protocols and desired traffic flows.</li>
  <li>Focus on keeping the source routing domain loop-free.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The underlying principle in preventing the formation of loops in a multipoint 
mutual redistribution network, at each redistribution point, routes from a 
source protocol need to be allowed into the destination protocol and these 
routes prevented from returning from the destination routing protocol back to the
source protocol.
</p>

<h3>Prefix Filtering</h3>
<p>
Prefix filtering can be implemented during the redistribution with some prefixes
filtered (prevented from being redistributed) on one redistribution device and 
permitted to be redistributed on another device. This can be used for controlled 
path manipulation.
</p>

<p>
Route filtering can be implemented during redistribution through the configuration 
of a route-map. The prefixes to be filtered are identified through the use of a 
prefix-list or access control list (ACL).
</p>
<h4>Filtering Connected Networks</h4>
<p>
Explicit configuration always overrides implicit configuration. When redistributing
the networks assigned to connected interfaces, the use of the network command 
advertises the networks of the connected interfaces. However, when filtering, if 
a filter excludes these networks, the networks configured on these interfaces 
will not be advertised. This affects all IGP protocols that use interfaces to form neighborships such as 
OSPF, EIGRP. BGP behaves a little different as it is enabled on a per neighbor-
basis and not per interface basis. If a route-map references an access list or prefix-list to 
identify interfaces to be filtered (not redistributed), these 
interfaces should be identified using the permit ACL keyword.
</p>

<h3>Route Tagging</h3>
<p>
A route tag is associated with routes during redistribution. A route-tag is a 
numeric value associated with a route. Use of the AD of the source protocol for 
the route-tag is a good technique.
</p>
<p>
The use of route-tags is a more scalable solution. In the case of prefix-lists and ACLs, 
everytime a new prefix is added, the prefix-list or ACL needs to be updated to reflect 
this new addition. When creating route-tags, a recommended best practice is to tag 
routes using the administrative distance of the routing protocol. This way, it is 
easier to tell the origin of the route.
</p>

<h3>Increase Seed Metric</h3>
<p>
Increase the seed metric to a value higher and less preferred to locally originated 
routes.This can be done through any of the seed metric configuration methods.
</p>
<p>
Configuring different seed metric values for different prefixes helps with preventing 
sub-optimal routing through traffic shaping. The redistribution metric on one 
redistributing device can be made lower so that to reach these prefixes, traffic 
transits through a specific path.
</p>
<p>
The seed metric can be modified through a route-map using the <code><b>
set metric </b></code> command.

<h3>Administrative Distance</h3>
<p>
Increase the administrative distance for external routes on routing protocols 
that support it. Alternatively, the AD can be modified for preferred routes.
</p>

<h3>External Route Summarization</h3>
<p>
Summarizing routes as they are redistributed into the second domain if they are 
re-inserted back to primary routing domain. They are less specific and not taken.
</p>


<h3>Route-Maps</h3>
<p>
Route-maps can be used to prevent the formation of routing loops. Tools to 
match the traffic include: access-lists, prefix-lists, route-tags, communities (BGP),
administrative distance, distribute-lists(ACLs, prefix-lists), offset-lists(ACLs, prefix-lists).
</p>

<p>
In redistribution of EIGRP to OSPF, using route-tags, the tag for EIGRP is permitted 
on one mutually redistributing routing device and denied on another redistributing routing device.
</p>
<div>
For two protocols mutual redistribution at two points:
<code>
R1 BLUE:<br>
route-map o2E deny 10<br>
 match tag 90<br>
 route-map O2E permit 20<br>
 set tag 110<br>
 
 R1 RED<br>
 riyte-map E2O deny 10<br>
 match tag 110<br>
 route-map E2O permit 20<br>
 set tag 90<br>
 
 R2 RED<br>
 route-map O2E deny 10<br>
 match tag 90<br>
 route-map O2E permit 20<br>
 set tag 110<br>
 <br>
 R2 BLUE<br>
 route-map E2O deny 10<br>
 match tag 110<br>
 route-map E2O permit 20<br>
 set tag 90<br>
</code>
</div>

<h1>Redistribution Scenarios</h1>
<h2>Two-point Mutual Redistribution</h2>
<h2>Three-point Mutual Redistribution</h2>
<p>
If three protocols are involved in mutual redistribution at three points. The 
generic method to prevent the formation of routing loops when redistributing 
mutually between three or more protocols inside a route map:
<ol>
  <li>deny destination protocol</li>
  <li>match protocol 2</li>
  <li>match protocol 3</li>
  <li>match protocol 4</li>
  <li>match protocol n</li>
</ol>
The challenge with this redistribution is if the tag will be maintained when 
redistributing from protocol 1 to protocol 2 and then to protocol 3. For example
when redistributing from OSPF into EIGRP and subsequently into RIP. The tag is 
maintained when copying the routes from:

A solution would be for the following:
<div>
<code>
route-map O2E deny 10<br>
  match tag 90<br>
route-map O2E permit 20<br>
  match tag 120<br>
  set tag 120<br>
route-map O2E permit 30<br>
  set tag 110<br>
</code>
</div>
<p>
The above route-maps will only operate if configured as a system on all the 
mutually redistributing routers. The route-maps will operate as a system and 
potentially prevent loops in 99.999% of the cases.
</p>
<p>
However, some situations exist where the above route-map will not succeed in preventing
a routing loop.
</p>
<p>
When configuring redistribution, the configuration commands should be entered 
inside the destination routing protocol.
</p>

<h1>IPv6</h1>
<p>
By default, IPv6 does not include connected networks when doing redistribution.
IPv6 does not include the subnets keyword in OSPFv3. This is because IPv6 does 
not necessarily use the concept of classful networks. To redistribute connected networks, 
use the keyaword include-connected.
</p>
<p>
IOS XE no longer redistributes the connected subnets on the interfaces over which
the protocol is enabled. IOS XE routers will only redistribute route entries 
that exactly match the source protocol in the route table.
</p>
<p>
The keyword <code><b>included-connected</b></code> can be used with the 
redistribution command to include the locally connected prefixes in the 
dynamic routing protocol redistribution. The include-connected keyword only 
injects prefixes for interfaces that have a dynamic routing protocol enabled. To
inkect networks for interfaces without a dynamic protocol the <code><b> 
redistribute connected</b></code> command is still required.
</p>


TODO	:
Redistribute some local interfaces and not others. This results in the 
IP address of the excluded connected interfaces being removed from the 
routing table. The solution is to include a match statement for that 
interface in the route map.
